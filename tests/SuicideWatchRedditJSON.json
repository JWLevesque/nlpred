            "selftext": "Everything is my fault. If I didn\u2019t act so stupid when I was a kid maybe I could have lived a different life. \nI think I am just living in the past. But it\u2019s all I have to think about because I have nothing else to think about expect for movies and TV shows.\nI hate thinking about myself because it is all my fault and I am the reason my life sucks. \nI hate myself. I hate my personality. I hate how loud I get. I hate how my voice sounds. I hate how aggressive I am when I speak. I\u2019m not funny. I talk about things no one understands.\nI cry a lot. I\u2019ve cried all my life. My mom and dad just think I am crazy.\nI can\u2019t keep friendships. I have two close friends, but one has moved away and living in another state. My other friend has other friends, sadly, and has a busy life. I doubt we\u2019ll be friends.\nOther then that, I don\u2019t have any close friends. I wish I did. That\u2019s honestly all I ever want. I know it\u2019s stupid, but I don\u2019t think I have ever had a REAL friend. I mean, my friend in another state, but she has other friends. \nI know I sound like I am overthinking it, but I don\u2019t have a life. I want a job, I want to drive, but I am a terrible driver, and I honestly don\u2019t understand somethings. My dad gets mad because I ask him the same stuff over and over again, but idk\nI like to draw, I\u2019ve been wanting to make money from commissions and stuff for awhile. BUT, I have just come back to it, and with a new style. I feel so hopeless about it. I feel like it is destroying me. I always hear people talk about surrounding yourself with positive things, but I can\u2019t, and the little character I draw is a chihuahua, based on my old dog Bingo. He died a few years ago. \nOnce again, I am living in the past.\nI am having trouble connecting with people. I don\u2019t know why, but people who \u201crelate\u201d to me the most are the ones who are worse than I. \nI don\u2019t feel anything for my cat. I wish I did. But she is just...there. And I hate that. \nI write a lot of screenplays, but I never feel confident enough to share them, or sometimes finish them. I want to be a filmmaker, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\nI went on a college visit last friday and I didn\u2019t feel anything. My dad was annoying me at first because we went with me on the tour, it was only us though, but he seemed more interested in it then me. Haha. That didn\u2019t annoy me. I just let it go.\nBut I felt so ugly there. Not physically, just I felt like I shouldn\u2019t be there. My dad got mad at me when I didn\u2019t tell him what was wrong. How could I? He\u2019d just think I am crazy again.\nI saw everyone talking to each other, and I think it bothers me because it seems like everyone has someone. I feel like I have no one. Yeah, my two friends, but I never see them. My brother lives an hour away from me. It seems like all my friendships are through text. That makes me feel even more alone.\n\nI think about all of this, it\u2019s good to write out what you\u2019re feeling because it\u2019s like organizing your thoughts. I feel calm now. I don\u2019t know. \nI guess because I wish for things but nothing happens. I talk to people who don\u2019t invite me to hang out with them. People have similar humor to me, and same favorite shows but...they don\u2019t like me. \n\nI have so many people on here message me and try to be my friend but it feels so...fake. I want people in my life to just click with me. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard.\n\nI hate a lot of things about me.\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where I am just...everything I don\u2019t like.\nOr maybe it\u2019s just because I am living a life I don\u2019t want.\nAnd I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s wrong.\nMaybe it\u2019s because people like to assume things about me. \nLike how they think I am some cat-obsessed person.\nOr how strangers think I am 12 years old.\nI am turning 18 in a month.\nSome people think I don\u2019t like to hang out outside of school? \nI wish they understood I never get invited.\nEveryone assumes I am dead serious about everything I say.\nIt\u2019s horrifying how people act about it.\nI wish my old friends never told anyone that I \u201chate everyone.\u201d\nI don\u2019t.\nEveryone is weird around me and treats me like I am a kid. Very nice talking. \nI love my science and art teacher, though sometimes they think I am serious.\nI don\u2019t talk much in their classes anymore and I don\u2019t know why.\nPeople say they love me and can see me \u201cgoing places.\u201d\nAll of my old friendships end because people see how boring I am.\nAnd how hard I try.\nI am so alone.\nI am so alone.\n\nI don\u2019t even want to go to college at this point. And the college I probably would go to is really nice and everyone seems friendly.\nBut I just can\u2019t socialize.\nAnd be wanting to be a filmmaker, I feel like I need to socialize.\nBut honestly, besides that, I\u2019d love to make friends.\n\nI just don\u2019t know how to accept who I am. Is it bad that I feel better when I can relate to fictional characters?\nI hate it. I do. I feel so alone and stupid when I do. \n\nI am hating myself because I just avoid people \u201clike me.\u201d\nThere\u2019s this one kid, he\u2019s alone. In middle school he wrote a hit list of everyone on his bus. He got sent to a mental hospital.\nHe came back freshman year and everyone was and is still worried he\u2019s going to shoot up the school.\nI\u2019ve talked to him and I don\u2019t think he is that way. I just think he is very lonely.\nBUT I DON\u2019T WANT TO BE HIS FRIEND?\nI fear he has a crush on me. Or maybe he is just trying too hard to be my friend. Either way, I don\u2019t like it. \nIs that wrong? Am I the bad guy? \nMaybe I don\u2019t want to be his friend because he is like me.\n\n\nIt's all my fault. My life has nothing to it because it's my fault. I can't learn to drive right because of me, everyone hates me because of me. I say all the wrong things because of me. I try, I do, but no one believes me and I just end up failing again. I know it is only high school but I just feel so stupid because my whole 17 years of life has been wasted on horrible friends and me just trying to fit in. I don't fit in with anyone. Creative people seem to be popular and happy. These days everyone has more then 2 real friends and I don't get it. Maybe I am just overreacting. I don't know. I don't know. Why is it I am doing everything wrong?? All the friends I make are wrong, all the drawings I draw seem wrong, my stories, even myself. I feel so wrong and stupid and I just hate myself. It's all my fault. I hate myself even more because I just don't know what to do anymore. I post a lot, and I listen, I understand, but nothing seems to work.\n",

            "selftext": "I can't do this anymore. I hate who I am, I absolutely hate myself. I hate how I was raised to be socially awkward and my family is so dysfunctional. it's like I'm literally incapable of carrying conversation with anyone unless it's about something negative and event then I'm terrible at it. and I've tried to work on this for years but there's nothing. I've been told by boys I was interested in that I'm boring and have no personality and they're right. what even is there to talk about? it's just meaningless. I can only get close with one person at a time, be it a friend or boyfriend. my best friend and I have been fighting a lot lately and she's been getting (rightfully) angry at me because I don't know how to talk to people so I say mean things around others. it's like I physically can't stop myself from being negative when I'm trying to get people to like me because I have no idea how to talk about anything else. she's also been getting on my nerves a LOT lately and I can feel our friendship falling apart and I have no one else I'm close with because I've only ever been close with one person at a time.\n\nthe boy that I'm in love with has feelings for a close friend of mine and while it's not reciprocated by her, it still hurts. she can carry conversation with him and be a nice normal, not awkward, not constantly on guard, person. he deserves that and I wish I could be that.\n\nI just don't want to scar my little siblings by killing myself. I have a little sister and a little brother and they both seem to love me, but then again maybe my death would make them closer and be good for them.\n\nI also have no idea what I want to do with my future, my gpa is 1.0, and I feel constantly hopeless. I'm so lost\n\nI'm so lost",

            "selftext": "I've had anxiety and depression for as long as I remember. My dad walked out on me and my mother is an emotionally abusive and unkind woman that constantly tells me how I'm a burden meanwhile my brother can basically do no wrong even though he's disregarded his education and can't pick up after himself. I currently hate the college I'm in but can't afford anywhere else unless I downgrade to a college that wouldn't even have a good program for my major. Even colleges close to my house that don't fall under this category also have the problem of requiring me to live in the same house as my mom again- who thinks that no matter what any problem in college is my fault just because I don't try hard enough. Every time someone asks me what I plan to do after college I just lie and say I'll go into marketing or something when really I'm thinking about how I just want everything to end. I'm so tired. I'm tired of never being someone's first choice, of being a plan b friend, of feeling like shit because I can never put my full trust in someone ever again because I don't want to be hurt anymore since I get enough hurt from my inescapable family. I'm usually considered someone's rock or emotional support- but when I need the same help from those people they're quick to turn their backs to me- or they'll act like my mom and say my feelings are invalid. It feels like I'm constantly cornered all the time with no escape and no one to turn to. Sometimes I google guns for sale because I fantasize about just pulling the trigger on one and erasing everything in an instant. It used to be just slitting my wrists but with past experiences with cutting myself the stinging is just too much. I'm not looking for help, nothing makes the feeling go away permanently so why bother",

            "selftext": "I've been depressed since my early teens, for a number of reasons I wont get into here, and since then I feel like things have only gotten worse, especially now I'm in my early 20s. My way of dealing with it all has always been to keep it to myself and deal with each day as it comes. But it's getting to the point now where I can't keep holding it back, I long for someone to confide in, to take comfort in. So after reading through reddit posts and advice pieces I came to the conclusion talking to people close to me is the way to go. I tried, with 2 separate people I consider to be very close to. I explained my depression to them, how it leaves me feeling every day, how I really don't want to commit suicide but every day it looks more and more like the only option left to me. Both times I was met with a lukewarm to cold response. It turned awkward very quickly and it was clear they didn't want to be on the subject, and neither have asked me about it since. I had this prevailing idea in my head that, once I finally plucked up the courage to talk, that something would happen, I would find something I'd been missing for a long time. But now it feels worse and like I have even less options than I felt I had before. I really don't know what to do now",

Work fucked me over again, no hours the whole week because a few degenerate coworkers got the department in trouble. I've called out one too many times from work for school. So as a result, they're thinking of firing me. Failed another two tests for school, going to be put on academic probation. Only way to dig myself out is by some fucking miracle. Still a virgin in college. Most of my friends are gone. Picked up smoking cigarettes, hope it kills me. Failing every class because I can't get out of the depression that's been with me for God knows how long. I feel no purpose or joy. All I do is work, and still fail. Meds barely get me through the day. Unloved, unhappy, and all around fucking miserable. Tried switching majors, but my GPA is so unbelievably fucked that I'll have to start at a deficit. Why even try. Why even care. Gaining weight again because there's no time between work, school, and homework for a gym. I haven't had any fun conversations in months. Family situation is getting worse. Mom is psychotic, claiming that my sisters and I all have eating disorders, my one sister is never home anymore l, the other is too miserable to even communicate. My dad is bearing down all his obsessions onto me and my major. The moment he comes home from work, I'm being hounded and yelled at. I no longer have any interests in anything. My mental issues (OCD/Depression) are becoming too much. The debt I'll be swimming in is already tormenting me. \n\n\nJesus Christ. I can't do this anymore. Everyday. Without pause. Seeing people on campus happy, in relationships. It's heartbreaking to know im incapable of achieving anything close. I understand I'm not alone. I know others have it worse. But, no less, I am at my wits end. Sanity is gone, patience used up. I'll do the world a favor, and I will purge myself from existence. No one needs an ugly, idiotic, misanthropic, miserable waste of human space. Unloved, unhappy. I'll think it over a bit but, I don't know. Life sucks and it always had. Luck of the draw is a part of prosperity, and I lost the gamble, and my 'skill' was not enough. Hopefully I die in my sleep",

My parents either raped me or blamed me for it. I heard that the quality of relationships after trauma influences the extent of the ptsd afterwards. If that's true then I'm so fucked. I've been going to therapy, and I feel like I've got some of my body back but that the poison has all collected in my head and is ready to erupt. I'm scared to sleep because of nightmares. I've also ruined my education and completely wasted any potential I had because it took me way too long to get help. Dropping out of school over and over again while other people my age are succeeding as well as relaxing, having fun and enjoying human intimacy. I feel like everyone I've ever known just sees me as a lost cause. People in my family have their own shit and would rather I was dead.",

Killing myself would prevent any good things happening to me but also nothing bad can happen to me. I'll also be dead so why does it really matter?\n\n\nI'm honestly just looking to find a way to talk myself out of it but I can't just find a way.

My ex cheated on me and I\u2019m sure the person I like will do the same. In fact, he probably doesn\u2019t even like me because he always leaves early when we hang out after class. \n\nMy parents don\u2019t show me a lot of affection and I feel so very disassociated from them. There\u2019s so much negative energy around and my mom talks about suicide so much and hates it whenever I say I feel depressed or even anxious. \n\nI\u2019ve already had two years of my life drained away while taking college courses early. No prom, no yearbook pictures, no inside jokes. This is the first time I regret homeschooling and going to college early. \n\nI want to restart my life and end this one. I hate thinking that it\u2019ll be better when it never has. I hate thinking my life is going uphill when it never has. It never never never has. \n\nI hope I don\u2019t wake up. \n\n ",

I don't know if I'm too much of a coward to do what I want or that I still have some courage left in me not to do it.\n\nEvery day I try find a reason to end it all, something that will give me the courage to do it, but i can't.\n\nBut even if i don't do it, even if I decided not to do it, then what?\n\nLive long enough to get a disease like my grandmother and not recognize my own self anymore?\n\nI've decided that if I can't do it directly, I will do all within my power to make my life last as little as possible.\n\nI'm now smoking a pack every day, eating like there is no tomorrow, stopped exercising, stopped leaning new languages (something I loved to do but cant do it anymore), studying and everything, hopping one day something, like a car crash or a thug, take my life away from me because I'm too much of a coward to do it myself.\n",

            "selftext": "Everyday I wake up extremely paranoid, depressed and it eats at me everyday, I feel guilty about everything i've done. Most people seem to make it worse when I talk to them (pointing out the little flaws or my mannerisms or the way I act), they never have anything good to say so I stay inside and I don't go outside. I'm constantly paranoid. I believe that most people are hostile and when they are hostile i'm incredibly vulnerable so I make sure I'm alone most times. I just wish I could be in a happy place, back to my childhood when I didn't give a fuck about debt, jobs, tax's. Growing up into the mundanity of the real world is so horrifically life-shattering and bleak. Money dictates the real world and everything we do. So many people are driven by money and over half of the population is driven by greed, Money is our second God. A sad world. \n\nI have no talents and I no longer care about my passion because it is driven by the one thing i detest the most and that is money. I'm a complete fraud in my practice, I feel like a fake artist, I can't make anything good, all of my work is garbage and I hate all of it. The fact I've come to the realisation that my main passion, the thing that kept me alive has broken me, especially the people I've worked with on my projects who I thought I could trust but can't means I'm left all alone. The industry is a cruel place and means there's nothing left for me to pursue, I get shot down all the time. I'm awful at so many other aspects of life and I'm doomed to perdition.\n\nI sort of see life as one grim apocalyptic setting, the worlds dying and we along with it too. Everything I see is morbid, it's just death, violence (I do not choose to see these bad things, I always try to watch a comedy film or something life changing but even they aren't funny anymore), or if there is something 'funny' I rarely see the funny side. I always have to put on a fake smile so people think I'm enjoying this insufferable existence. I've tried things to change it. listening to new music, nope. tried reading books, nope. tried working at my passion, nope. tried meeting new people, nope. I don't have any friends, so that's out of the equation. tried meditation, nope. heating healthily, nope. talking about metal health, nope. etc.\nI've been trying these things for a while but nothing works, I'm stuck on earth and the earth is bleeding to death.\n\nEven not having a partner (not like i'm ever going to get one lol), at times, can be frustrating but I imagine having a partner would be worse. They would have to bare the suffering just as much as myself and there would be no intimate connection. I reckon sex would feel like nothing even if it was with someone I loved, because I too feel empty, even when I do have a strong libido, I just feel so empty afterwards, it's pathetic.\n\nI can't even say 'I love you' to my family because it means nothing, even it has a lot of meaning, It just feels like nothing.\n\nIn terms of suicide, I think a lot about it, nearly everyday but the last time I attempted was over a year ago. Life is pointless but I also believe suicide is just as pointless. Don't get me wrong, I know life isn't easy, none of us do, I like a challenge but there's so much that one can bare. If you ever met me in person, you'd say I was probably the most pessimistic person you'd ever had the displeasure of meeting.\n\nI could go on blabbering about my pathetic existence but since I have no one to talk to, this is the last place I've chosen to share with (and my shit grammar and punctuation).\n",

            "selftext": "I really do I was there a few times when I was younger I haven\u2019t even thought about suicide in years ... I used to think people would be happier without me and that I don\u2019t contribute anything to this world I am not the smartest person I am a high school grad but never went farther then that - I had deep deep holes  I was in and never thought I\u2019d get out but I kept pushing I kept fighting and here I am not thinking about suicide anymore and here I am hoping I can at least change one persons mind about it, death doesn\u2019t scare me I\u2019m the kind of person who thinks death is just a (start over) I don\u2019t believe in heaven or hell \u2018per say\u2019 I believe the sole goes on to whatever it can I don\u2019t kill bugs in my house I try to let them go free outside and if I accidentally hit an animal on the road I get upset that I took its life (maybe that sounds dumb) but I think \u201cwhat if I die and come back as this\u201d I wouldn\u2019t want someone smashing me for no reason at all.... others believe in the heaven and hell which is fine I\u2019m not saying that don\u2019t exist because I don\u2019t know? I\u2019ve know people who has died 20+ years ago if I died right now I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be magically placed right next to my loved ones in heaven and we carry  on from that point (like I said sounds nice but I don\u2019t believe that) - I do believe in god I don\u2019t think we\u2019re here on accident -for all we know we could be someone\u2019s any farm in their front room? I would think about death as an easy way out a way to escape my pain and at one time I had a 4-10 shotgun sitting next to me thinking about all the pain I would be ending but also thinking about the pain I would be causing :who would find me? My mom my so? my kid? I wouldn\u2019t want anyone I know to find me dead from suicide because that would cause pain on them pain they would have to live with and question themselves what did they do wrong? So then I always thought I could make it look like an accident but then thought what if I end up killing someone else\u2019s loved one in the process -(car crash)- all this was going through my head I couldn\u2019t stop it and I was going back and forth why or why not should I or shouldn\u2019t I ..... I shouldn\u2019t I should live I\u2019m 40 now I\u2019m lucky if I have another 40 years to go probably not I wish I could go back and know what I know now because I would\u2019ve never wasted so much time thinking about death I would\u2019ve tried to enjoy life a little longer while I could.... life is mysterious and strange but it\u2019s worth exploring its worth living death will inevitably arrive there\u2019s no escaping that but what comes with death? No one knows and no matter what you think it doesn\u2019t matter because you don\u2019t know I\u2019m sorry if this is rambling and super long but bottom line is this ....death will come but life may never happen again",

            "selftext": "I live in one of the worst cities in the east coast for the opiate epidemic. I can't go anywhere without meeting creeps, junkies, tweakers, and other people who want to drag me down their fucked up path. I walked out of my job because the kitchen is plagued with drugs and ignorance and I want no part of it. I was a heroin addict for half of 2017 and I thought I had a good chance to fix things, but I really fucked up good. Here's the situation:\n\nTwo days ago I met a friendly deadhead at a gas station who needed a ride and a place to stay. I accepted as I am an altruistic being and I was having a good conversation about this guy. I bring him back home and he plays some tunes on my guitar and we start jamming. The next day I go out for a drink with one of my roommates and she tells me a story about how our other roommate went out to dinner with friends and encountered a man matching the description of the one I picked up. He told my roommate he would cover the meal, but turned and said my roommate was  paying for him as it came time for the check. It turns out, it's the same dude. I need to tell him he can't live with me but he's piss drunk all the time and I know he will freak at me if I tell him what the deal is. \n\nI don't know how to get this man out of my apartment. He's currently passed out on my floor as I'm typing this on my phone at a coffee shop. I'm at my breaking point and the only thing keeping me from blowing my brains out is the fact that my roommate needs me to find another job and pay rent. I'm a scum magnet piece of shit and I only bring misery and pain into people's lives. I don't deserve to be happy. I don't deserve to have friends. I don't deserve to live in this fucked up world.\n\n",

I will either end my life by hanging, stabbing, or overdosing. Am I sure? Yes, but not quite. If I cry more than 7 times in this period of time, then I will choose to end everything. If I don\u2019t, then I will wait and see how my life goes from there. Why am I killing myself? Because I seriously think that everyone would be better off without me. I extremely despise thinking about living this life another day because of how much everyone hates me for rumors that aren\u2019t even true. It just feels like no one fucking understands me anymore, so it\u2019s so hard to ask for help. I\u2019m posting this to reddit because none of you know me and I don\u2019t want to worry those who really care about me.

            "selftext": "So basically since last year my friend is always joking about killing himself. For example in January I asked him his plans for the year and he said \"killing myself\" laughing, another time we were talking about how not sleeping is bad and he goes \"well I don't care, if I die it would be even better\". Now today on our way to school he asked me if I heard about the suicide of a 17 years old boy, I didn't know about it and he explained to me that he was bullied and jumped off a bridge, then he told me that he read his suicide letter and teared up a little because it described what he felt. I asked him what did he feel and he told me that he feels not understood and alone and  told me in a joking manner that he would jump too if he wasn't scared and it didn't hurt, then  I asked  \"why?\" and he told me that he  just wanted  to see what there is after death, I couldn't ask anything else because we had to go to class. After school on the bus we started talking again about that boy and he reapetedly told me \"where did he get all that courage?\" like he wanted it too and \" everyday feels the same: get up, get ready for school, eat etc...\". I couldn't talk to him properly because we didn't have a lot of time and we were on a bus. Now this is really worrying me and I don't really know what to tell him, should I also tell someone else since we're both 15? There's a counselor at my school but I can only talk to her this friday, I'm also going to his house this thursday so should I do something then? Should I tell him to get help? Everytime I ask him what's wrong he starts laughing and looks uncomfortable and doesn't tell me anything. He also doesn't think that counselors or therapists help people so telling him to get help is a bit hard. He never seems serious when telling me these things and I don't really know if he is really capable of doing something like that. What do I do?\n",

            "selftext": "Growing up I didn't have any responsibilities. I was spoiled and didn't see the value of money. Anyways, I lived a very minimal lifestyle. Taking the bus everywhere and paying for what I can afford. I didn't have a car, or a lot of things and what not. Lived at my parents place for a long time. I got jobs here and there and the went off to college. In college I was a good student, got good grades and received some jobs. I met my girlfriend there and we started to drink and smoke and meet hang out. We did everything together and then I moved in with her near the end of college. She never owned a car or credit card or anything that has a lot of responsibilities to handle. She enjoyed being social and drinking, making friends. After college her well off parents decided that we should do a business that was run by their family. We made a partnership and have joint bank account. We made alot of money but everything was just practically given to us. We were children and didn't understand the importance of responsibilities. During the time of our work, her father did everything for us. All the paperwork for the vehicle, emission tests, insurance and everything was divided between us two. Everything was going good. We started going crazy with our money. Drinking, travelling, buying a lot of shit, eating out, living in the city, motorcycles, storage units. We had to take a business loan to pay our taxes. Then we had no more work and had no more money. We decided to join the military. Worst mistake of my life. The movers came and took all my stuff under my name and she went in before I did. I packed the truck and went after her. During time at basic, she started to spend a lot of money on the CC. I was fucking stressed out, but I still cared for her. Completing basic, I went to my next posting where she also was located. I started to quickly realize that her habits of spending was the same and that she doesn\u2019t seem to have any real responsibilities. I saved some money, but she wasted it all on drinking and partying everyday. All she wanted to do was to be social and make friends, not caring about real responsibilities. I got more and more stressed out about the shit that I owned and responsibilities and eventually pissed her right off. It dawned on me that I have no more money, no more shit and I have a vehicle and payments and a bunch of other shit stuck in storage. I\u2019m actually scared for my life now. I started feeling very trapped in the military, with her, our financial situation and all the shit that we own. Seeing her get picked up by another new bf. I felt suicidal. I still do. I was sent to the hospital for them to start giving me pills and shit. Saying what is wrong with me. I felt scared for life. This is because we both were just children. I needed to get out and start figuring shit out because I won\u2019t have a future if I pursue the military with all the responsibilities that I have now tied with her, but I felt that getting out still won\u2019t do anything. She lives in her own bubble still in the military and lives off the business cc connected to my name. But I started to realize I don\u2019t know how to do anything and that my life is extremely complicated. That being an adult with all these things and payments is actually important. I don\u2019t know where my papers are for anything. I don\u2019t know how to do taxes. I don\u2019t know ANYTHING! I left the military and went back to my parents place for help, but they can\u2019t see the extreme complexity of my life. Millions of people are involved with my life. I have the military stored all our shit together and trying to get it out is a nightmare. I really got the shit end of the stick. I lost everything in my life. Love, friends, job, passions, my personality and everything I worked for. It\u2019s all gone. I\u2019m going to ruin my family\u2019s life. I feel sick every day with worry, anxiety, depression, and panic attacks What the fuck do I do. I didn\u2019t plan for this at all. In fact, it feels like I didn\u2019t plan for anything in my life. I don\u2019t understand reality. Now I have realized I built my life around her. That all my strength and joy came from her. I have no will to do anything anymore. I have no one to talk to. All I think about is a constant cycle of problems that are in my life which drives me to a mental state of insanity. I miss the old days of sleeping beside her, with our cat, going on adventures and meeting with friends, talking about life and dreams. Nothing seems worth it in this life anymore. The only reason why I am here is because I can\u2019t stand the thought of my mother finding out I killed myself. Time is extremely slow now. I have taken the red pill and see how shitty life is. I\u2019m in the Matrix. I\u2019ve imprisoned my mind thinking about the past and future. Stuck in the suburbs without anything promising down the road all the while bill and debt is eating me away. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. I have experienced too much beauty in this world and now it will be bleak forever. My dreams are gone and I have nothing to left to live for. I feel weak every day. My parents are trying to help, but they don't know how I feel. How difficult it is to communicate to them the lifestyle I lived. I am at the bottom of Maslows' hierarchy of need. I wish for a reset button for my life but reality set in and I can\u2019t rebuild anything.",

He prescribed me anti psychotics which made me really weak, and killed my taughts , emotions, feelings , empathy , and libido . ( I was against treatment from the very beginning but my parents forced me. I was actually handling life really well with law of attraction videos, positive talks and affirmations from YouTube mixed with kickboxing classes, going out and swimming at night - that was very therapeutic for some reason - Life was worth living for a while)\n\nSo it really feels like it's time to move on and am ready to buy some Nembutal but with that being said I'm afraid that it might get stopped by customs. Would I face jail time if that happened ? (I live in a European country)",

This is what has been keeping me from doing it.\nWhenever I feel sad every minor inconvenience is a really big deal, and my boyfriend always tells me, that I\u2019m overreacting (he even told me this, when I had a kidney stone).\nHe might be right though, but I still have to deal with the feeling of everything being inconvenient and overwhelming.\n\nRight now I think I\u2019m having trouble with my kidneys again, because there\u2019s blood in my urine, and my concentration of leukocytes in my urine is quite high too. I wish it was just a bladder infection, but it isn\u2019t, and I have to have more tests done tomorrow. This too is a major issue for me atm... \n\nIt\u2019s so weird. Sometimes I feel totally opposite of this, but right now everything has just turned into a negative.",

            "selftext": "Okay.  There are some things I genuinely, objectively do not deserve.  I don't deserve a Croatian Political Analyst of the Year award or an Olympic Gold for high jumping or a job doing hair braids.  All those things are pretty easy to reckon with emotionally and I wouldn't say my low/nonexistent standing in any of those fields really affects my self-esteem.  I don't deserve love and attention from a given person just because I chose them, because no one is entitled to be regent of anyone else's world.  That doesn't hurt me either, it's just good sense and the principles of human autonomy.\n\n\nBut then I start saying I don't deserve things I already have or things all humans have a right to or things that aren't really about deserving or not deserving.  Financial help from my parents?  A decent place to live?  The love of the friends I already have?  A job I like?  A job, period?  Happiness?  Success?  An education?  Self-worth?\n\n\nSometimes it's about relative privilege, how it's not fair that I get to have material comfort and stability and the disposable time to look for jobs and post on Reddit about my dumb feelings when so many others don't.  But instead of that translating in my head to, \"hm, there sure are a lot of structural flaws and cultural biases in our market and social organization systems that disadvantage huge groups of people!  I ought to use the relative power I have to push back against that while simultaneously attempting to enjoy my short life within the most amenable bounds of considerateness and selflessness that I can set,\" it becomes, \"I'm taking up all the good things so that worthier people can't get any, because apparently I buy into the idea that some people don't deserve basic welfare as long as it feeds my self-hate, but instead of doing anything about it I should probably just ball up under the table and stay there motionless for the rest of my life.\"  Productive.  Clearly I am the champion those of you with actual problems have all been waiting for.\n\n\nI think it's healthy for the privileged to feel a *bit* bad about it.  We need to be able to empathize with people who have our problems but life-alteringly worse, to check ourselves if we start to believe our victories are the result of merit alone and that surely those in dire straits just aren't working hard.  (Incidentally, I am wary of dating SUPER CONFIDENT similarly privileged men for basically this reason along a gender axis, so not-totally-sure-of-themselves lads of the world, rejoice.)\n\n\nBut it's not much help to anyone if the only thing we can apply that feeling to is sitting about in our filth wishing we were dead.\n\n\nThis is not to say at all that privilege is responsible for the illness - I find it much more likely that the illness just grabs whatever it can find in your personal belief and politics to burn you on internally (financially stable lefty - sheltered much?!) and the messages of your wider culture to do so externally (Extended unemployment, eh?  Maybe you're just a lazy snake person leech with no original ideas who studied too \"girly\" a subject and whines about bias when her skills aren't competitive in beautiful pure shining capitalism!  Also something about how women don't have real hobbies and you're clearly faking your interest in yours.).\n\n\nI can't speak for people with serious money problems but I bet if I'm here feeling guilty* about not being \"productive\" enough in a money-making sense, the illness must *really* do a number on you with actual financial insecurity.\n\n\n*And it's not just guilt about taking from my parents - it feels almost like a moral obligation to the ideal of the capitalist work ethic, like even working the most repugnant high-level job for the slimiest corporation is morally superior to not doing paid work at all.  Kinda like how women/people feel pressure to publicly self-flagellate on the issue of fat unprompted, as if having fat is offensive not only in terms of beauty standards and (sometimes fallacious) health concerns but _morally_.  Like just existing in a fat body in public is something you have to apologize for and work against on par with a violent anger disorder that makes you unable to stop farting at strangers.\n\n\nI guess try to draw a distinction between the stuff you don't deserve and the stuff you're lucky to have.",

Mistake after mistake, regret after regret but trying to live through hoping for something good to happen is not gonna work cuz it\u2019s not gonna happen. I\u2019m 25 homeless and no job I abuse alcohol and drugs for a while now but it wasn\u2019t always like that I recently started this bad habit just to get through the day. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t want to do anything. My family has abandoned me which is pretty normal when things get too complicated. My friends, pfft I have no friends. My therapist was helping for a while but it doesn\u2019t take much to bring me down and down the spiral I go. Killing myself seems like the best solution so I won\u2019t bother anyone again and I can finally Rest In Peace. Anyway I came up three ways to kill myself but the first option cost money which I don\u2019t have or the patience to gather. The second option I came up with is messy and painful in the beginning but quick to get the job done. My last option which is the one I didn\u2019t want to do because it involves other people and I didn\u2019t want to do that, cuz I\u2019m a gentleman, but now I don\u2019t really care sacrifices need to be made then so be it. Oh but nobody should get hurt physically anyway. Honestly I\u2019m on the borderline and confused about whether I should keep struggling cuz I was hoping to fall in love one of these days but that is unlikely or if I should end this suffering, misery, and loneliness once in for all.

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been depressed for about 3 years now.  It\u2019s fluctuated in severity, and I\u2019ve been terrified to see a therapist after hearing horror stories about being sent to an ER for a suicide watch.  My husband is an amazingly supportive and strong person who tries his best to help, but it\u2019s almost impossible for me to talk to him about this.  Not for lack of trying on his part; he wants me to talk to him, but I can see how scared and concerned he gets when I get honest.  So I figured I\u2019d try to talk about it here.  Not a throwaway, because I\u2019d like to be honest about this with myself.\n\nThe suicidal thoughts have been creeping in throughout the last year.  Occasionally, they\u2019re aggressive; sometimes they\u2019re much easier to beat back.  There\u2019s no warning, no trigger, nothing in particular that sets it off.  But the last three weeks have been constant, and over the weekend, something snapped.  I was at a convention as an artist, meeting lots of new people, spending time with friends and husband.  But all I could think about was dying.  I can usually draw the line between \u201cwanting to die\u201d and \u201cactually being suicidal\u201d, but this weekend, I just wanted to actually stop breathing, and to make that happen.  I wanted to look up methods, I wanted to plan out my finances to make things easier on my husband, and I wanted to write whatever I felt I had to say to friends and family.  And I wanted it to start happening. \n\nI\u2019m terrified, but for too many reasons to figure out.  Maybe I\u2019m scared of dying, maybe I\u2019m afraid that my husband will snap and follow me out, but honestly, I think I\u2019m really just afraid of messing up and having to deal with that aftermath.  \n\nI don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m looking for.  I think I want help.  I think, in my gut, that I don\u2019t want to do this.  But I can\u2019t ignore the constant stream of angry, horrible static in my head and my heart.  It\u2019s a steady stream of noise that occasionally clears into messages: you\u2019re not going to fix this, you\u2019re going to fail, there\u2019s no point, they don\u2019t need you, etc.  My chest is constantly full of this heavy dread, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about escape.  I just want to escape.  Whatever I can do to get out of this, I want to do it.  ",

            "selftext": "Hi guys this is my first Reddit post. I never use reddit, but heard it\u2019s communities are full of good people. I made this account just so I can talk to somebody. Here it goes.\n\nFirst of all I\u2019m pretty young (11). First of all started after my best friend no longer wanted to be my friend. It was in year 4 and I was so heartbroken that I just froze in shock after he told me he didn\u2019t want to be my friend. We spent so much time together messing around, playing, running, laughing and talking. That made a hole in my heart. More things happened after that, my mum kept and fighting with my dad (they still fight) and they would shout so much I would run into my room crying. My dads father passed away and he got so depressed it stung me when he cried. Then another person had to go away from me. My grandpa. I was at my absolute lowest at this point. I felt so lonely because I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone, my parents think people who commit suicide are cowards. It gets harder to put on a smile at school every single day. As if it couldn\u2019t get worse, I lost all my friends that I had left and my cousins started to hit me. Someone pull me out of this hell hole. I\u2019ve had enough with life, I\u2019m so young and I want to live life. I wish I could go back to when I was 6. Playing with my cousin till 3am, eating snacks. Back to when my brother and I played on our ps3. Back to when I hugged my dad every night. Back to when I was alive.\n\nI have my Suicide notes ready to send out to all the people who made my life a misery and those who made my life worth living. I\u2019m all ready to commit suicide. Someone make my life worth living. ",

            "selftext": "I'm 17, nearly 18 and I have been skipping school for about 6 weeks. My mom found out last Friday but she thought I only skipped school last week. This morning we went to school but when we were in front of the school I rode my bike away (we walked to school since she doesn't have a car). I'm sitting at a bus stop and typing this on my phone. I have decided to suicide today and I should have done this much sooner but I was too lazy. I need to somehow get inside my house to suicide but apparently my mom skipped work and I can't just suicide by hitting a car since people drive too slow to actually kill me. Well I can only blame this on myself, I skipped school because I'm lazy and tired with life, I have no ambition and not interested in any profession. I have no friend at school ever except last year when I had a girlfriend for a week before I broke up with her. I'm bad at socializing and my study has been getting worse because of my laziness (I was quite a good student before). I don't know since when but I have been empathetic or whatever for a long time, I just can't feel sympathy. I'm not good at anything and even often fk up things, the only good thing about me is probably that I'm not a bad person or I think so. My mom had raised me on her own for all this time but I guess I can only make her sad, especially when my sister is in the hospital with guillian barre syndrome (that's totally because of her lifestyle), my mom raised us well physically but not emotionally, she wasn't violent and didn't yell much but well it's hard to explain,and the result is that I have zero confidence in life. So basically I hope I can die today since I'm tired of living.",

I was placed in over 25 homes, institutions, and group homes.\nMost were abusive; physically, psychologically, sexually, verbally. Every time I tried to escape, I was placed back in that home, or in another, which usually was worse.\nI was adopted once at 9, by a gay man who was my mentor while I was younger. He too was abusive, physically. I had to run to a neighbors house half naked after being beaten bloody, and have the police called. That night I got placed in another home, which too was abusive. They made me wear pull ups, and sit outside the apartment complex, while I yelled and banged  on the door. No help.\n\nMy point is, every shred of fuckin hope I get is always, always destroyed. Some things are my fault, usually they aren't.\nI've grown so accustomed to being used by people. I've seen and felt so much pain, all I ever try to do is make people smile and  laugh, but in the process, I get walked over every single time.\nNow I've grown into a barely functioning individual, I can't work, I can't sleep, and when I do sleep, I can't wake up for work. I've lost 6 jobs in a year because I can't wake up to 10 fucking alarms.\nI can't go to college because I have massive panic attacks while I'm trying to solve problems and listen  to people. Medication and counseling does nothing when the muscle tension surrounding your skull is gripping and squeezing so fucking hard it's physically debilitating.\nI can't make friends because I never was allowed to go out and develop real social skills. I can't talk to people face to face because my PTSD kicks in, makes me panic, and the tension too kicks in.\n\nI can't eat, talk, breathe, sleep, think, or do anything basic of an autonomic function without being in fucking pain.\n\nI have ZERO friends, I have no family, I have a fuckin dollar in the bank, I sleep wherever the fuck my exhausted body makes me because I have no home.\nShelters are infested with bed bugs and lice. Fuck, the night before I've written this post, I was literally bitten over a hundred times by bed bugs in one night sleeping in a shelter. It's so fucking embarrassing to have bites all over my body that everyone can see as I ride the bus, or walk around.\n\nSo tell me, why shouldn't I kill myself? ",

            "selftext": "I'm 24 (m) and I literally feel like a complete failure at life. I have got a degree but am currently unemployed and living off my parents. I have been suffering from depression on and off for 6 years now. I feel like a complete joke. I have never had a girlfriend and I am struggling to see the point of anything. I also feel like a very weak person. Just sick of everything.\n\nA lot of my friends seem to be making progress in life, but I am still stuck doing nothing. I have made numerous changes in my life multiple times, but I always end up miserable no matter what. I got a job, but I was even more depressed that I was when unemployed. Moved to a different country, still miserable. I have zero motivation and absolutely hate working with/for other people.\n\nI generally have a pessimistic view of humanity and despise about 50% of people. I can't help this. Every time I try to be more optimistic, millions of things prove otherwise. Why kid myself. \n\nI abuse alcohol/drugs to the point of blacking out 1-2 times a week. I don't really care about stopping this as I don't really see the point. All that happens is I end up getting bored/depressed when sober. At least when I am hammered, I can forget about how much of a failure I am for a few hours.\n\nI am also pretty sure I am suffering with a serious mental illness. A lot of people have said to me that they think I am mentally unwell and need help. My behavior is completely erratic most of the time (especially when drunk).\n\nI have found myself idealizing suicide recently more often. I just think about how easy it would be to make all my problems disappear. I am pretty sure I am doomed to be miserable anyways so what is the point in going on.\n\nThe only reason I have not followed through is because of my family. They are very good people and they care about me a lot.\n\nI need help. ",

Others left *because* of said depression. I shouldn't have told them. I shouldn't tell anyone. But now I'm afraid I won't be able to keep going without them. They loved me, and I loved them too. Now I'm alone and I just want to die. I'm feeling so bad it hurts physically. I'll try and get my mother to find me a psychologist tonight. If that doesn't work I guess I'll just kill myself in the middle of the night so nobody notices. ",

            "selftext": "I (21 m) was diagnosed with depression when I was 11 and since then I've tried 6 different antidepressants. Right now I'm on welbutrin and lamictal and I still have no energy, ability to focus, memory issues, and a burning desire for nothing more than to catch the bus.\n\nI live alone and sometimes occasionally call my dad or sister. I have a good handful of friends in the city I live in, everyone knows me as smiling and happy. I try confiding in family about issues and they shut me out every time, but I do have a therapist I see once a week. I grew up with a BPD alcoholic mom so we are nc. I got kicked out at 16, moved into a homeless shelter then with my abusive ex. Then I got pregnant when I was 18 and gave the baby for adoption, which I still fucking regret. I wish I had my shit together and could care for him, but I was a mentally ill kid who could barely take care of himself.\n\nMy executive functioning is garbage, I can barely take care of mundane chores and my self. My last couple jobs only lasted a couple months each last year, and I have the desire to have a long term job again and feel stable but it doesn't feel possible when I can't even take care of dishes. I have trust issues and I'm really paranoid that people all have a goal of using me or hurting me in some way. I really have no supports or help besides government paying my bills and a therapist letting me spill my guts to her, as everyone else just wants the happy and smiling fake version of me.\n\nI just feel like a constant disappointment. Like a waste of government resources for them to pay for the living costs of someone who doesn't even want to live. I have the opportunity to get an education for free, have my living costs paid for, I should be psyched like any other person in their early 20s. It all just seems like waaay too much work. I'm just going to fail like every other attempt I've had at going back to school.  I don't have the energy to start all these things just to end up dropping it all again and hating myself even more for failing again. \n\nI'm very obese (310lbs) and it should be easy for me to start losing weight because I have such a high tdee. I've done a lot of reading about CICO and n how to start losing weight but I'm weak and buy fast food almost daily. I can't stop emotionally eating and feeling self-loathing afterward. \n\nI also have just over $1000 of financial debt that's been tagging along for almost a year and a half. I really don't feel like I'm capable of maintaining anything, let alone improving myself. Having most of everything written out helps put things into perspective for me at least, I really don't want to continue living everyday with the heavy guilt and self-hatred.\n\nIt all just makes sense to fucking end the pain. The only thing keeping me going is my pets but they'd be better off in another home anyway.",

Constantly calling me stupid and they just love to watch me fail. I would just blow it off and say, \"they just want to strengthen there giant ego,\" but i can't keep doing that anymore. My friends constantly assume I'm gay, or just accuse me of being a loser because im a virgin into my 20s. People may call me lucky to never have had to deal with a \"crazy bitch,\" but they dont understand. These people are only thinking off there perspective, and the moment they don't have anyone to get that quick short orgasm with they freak out. They say, \"I haven't gotten any pussy in 2 weeks, I WANT SOME PUSSY!\" Ill say, \"I haven't in over 20 years of existence\" they say, \"thats because you're gay and dont want pussy\" then laugh uncontrollably... It's heart wrenching and frustrating, because i know I can't prove them wrong. I'm sick and tired of everything, please someone make it all fucking stop! I haven't had a good moment in my life for as long as i remember. I think about being let go from this prison everyday, and it is the most comforting thought that with one moment it could all be over. No one in this world would even believe I'm depressed, They would just call me a fucking pussy. Fuck it all!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why am I still here???",

I was home alone looking after my son while my girlfriend was out for her mother\u2019s 70th. I have long struggled with drugs and alcohol and started drinking and taking Cocaine on my own. \n\nMy son was in bed asleep and I decided that when my girlfriend came home I would drive our car off a cliff.\n\nI waited until my girlfriend got in the shower then took the car and made for the hills. At the bottom of the Hill I said a few goodbyes. I misjudged where the best place to drive off would be and ended hitting a wall going about 80mph.\n\nI don\u2019t remember much but thinking \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t hurt\u201d, I then woke up and by some miricle I didn\u2019t die, intact I\u2019m not even majorly injured. \n\nI\u2019m now in deep trouble with the police, and I\u2019ve ruined the trust of my in laws (I live abroad). People keep saying how lucky I am to be alive, however I don\u2019t feel that lucky.\n\nSo what next? I don\u2019t know...",

            "selftext": "I just feel so lonely, and no one seems to like me. I know that sounds childish, but I don't know what else to think. \n\nI have 1 friend, and we don't talk as much as we used to. I try to hangout with her and she's busy, and she often ignores any memes or messages I send her. She really only contacts me when she needs something or is bored. \nRecently, we were going to hangout this Saturday. And then she cancelled on me, but I found out later she had a party with other friends of hers, she just uninvited me. She tried to hide it from me and made it seem like the other people just showed up out of the blue, but I know. She just didn't want me there. \n\n\nAnd my dad hates me. This past year he has gotten more toxic and hostile to me. I'm his daughter, and he spent an entire hour calling me fat and disgusting and a loser with no friends. I've seen his messages to my.mom calling me fat and lazy. He says I make my mental health issues up for attention, and I'm the reason that his and my mom's relationship is so strained. He's also locked me in my room once and shoved me on different occasions. I don't know why he hates me so much. \n\nAnd I am fat. I use eating as a way to deal and I'm trying to stop, I make all these plans and then something bad happens and I just want to eat and hide in my room. I use it as a comfort but it's making me miserable because of the weight I've gained and I don't know how to stop. \n\nI don't have a job, because I'm so anxious. And I really do want a job, but I'm so so scared. I'm scared of people making fun of me, or me making a fool of myself. If I'm so unlikable I don't want to be around people. I just mostly stay in my house. I had a job a couple years ago and I lasted 3 months before i had a breakdown and ended up hospitalized. I'm so fucking dumb. \n\nI'm 21 and I don't have my license or even my temps. Ive tried so hard to get my parents to teach me how to drive like they taught my brother and for some reason it's never the right time. \n\nI have no freedom. My mother seems to expect me to take care of everything, like doctor appointments for the whole family, making sure she doesn't overspend her money. If my mom gets to drunk it's my job to take care of her and my grandma, who has dementia. If I try to go upstairs to my room to play video games or read she makes backhanded comments about how she'll miss me, and how great it is I get to be alone and relax rather than take care of my grandma. It doesn't matter if I've been downstairs all day taking care of her. Somehow I'm abandoning my mom. It's almost like I have to be mother to both of them. \n\nAlot of these things are my fault. It's my fault I'm fat, and I don't have a job. I make so many dumb choices. I've been in therapy for years and I took a year off because I really thought I could fix myself, I use my coping skills and I try and teach myself how to handle things better and I am better at it than I was. But I still can't handle them properly and I just want to run away sometimes. I hate myself. \n\nI just feel so alone and like I'm a huge burden. I can't get over my anxiety, even when I force myself into social situations it doesn't seem to help. I just don't think I have anything to live for. I've tried for this past year to be positive and I made all these plans for myself and goals and I failed everything. I can't do this anymore. \nSorry for the long rant. ",

Or should they remember if they care as much as they claim to? I know everyone has got problems and their own lives to deal with. But all I ever hear is \"you should have told me things have gotten bad again\". But, what if it was your job to ask me how I was before it got bad again? You are one of only a few people who actually know, so why should I have to remind you that I am still here and that I'm still hurting? Yes we need to speak out and ask fro help, but what if we already have? What do we do then? Time passes and you go back to your life and forget, but for me, for us, it builds up inside us again, and now we are to scared to ask for help. Because you know, you know yet do nothing. I did my part and told you. Surely its now your job to do what you said you would and be there for me when I need help.\nI think now I am done reminding and asking. I'm going back to self destruction an isolation. When you care enough to ask me how I am, I will say I'm fine and it's up to you weather to believe me or not. Your answer will show how much you care. weather you are asking to actually find out, or weather you are just doing your duty by asking, then wiping your hands of me.   ",

As you can tell, I\u2019m in one of my lows right now. As much as I hate to admit it, I\u2019m scared. Not only do I suffer from Depression but I suffer from Schizoaffective as well. Things keep getting worse every time I have a \u201clow\u201d. I have nothing to live for, as typical as that sounds. Except for my mom. And she recently got diagnosed with cancer. I know for a fact I won\u2019t be able to live without her. I\u2019m incredibly tempted to just off myself before she passes so I don\u2019t have to deal with it. I know how selfish that sounds. I feel awful. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t think I ever have. I don\u2019t want to go back inpatient. I\u2019m running out of options. Please, God, someone help me. I\u2019m feeling a little hysterical. I just want this all to be over. I just want someone to care.",

            "selftext": "Trying to keep this short. My whole life was always a struggle but now I\u2019m at a breaking point, I\u2019m only 19, alcoholic, I sleep all day long, parents had ugly divorce (dad still talks to me and cares) mom is a whore she left the family for some rich man hence the divorce, ruin the family, he recently dumped her and now she moved back into the house with my brother and I. She sleeps on the couch and My brother treats me like shit, can\u2019t even clean his own dishes, and cuts me down just like my mom does. They secretly talk about me when I can hear them and say things about trying to get rid of me, like putting me into a crazy house. (I already been into crazy houses twice and it terrifies the fuck out of me. I refuse to ever go into one again so no don\u2019t say that to me.) no job, dui no license, no friends never had any, I gotten to the point to meet strangers online and talk with them which is fine, but, I just want a hug every once and awhile and I can\u2019t even remember the last time I had one. I cry myself or drink myself to sleep or take benzos. (Yes I\u2019m prescribed to them since my recent OD) I recently moved back home to live in this house. I drove myself 4 days to California alone last year in July to be with a family member who unexpectedly died in front of me (heart attack) so then, I was then living alone, yes, 19 and living alone in cali fucking fornia. I had a job out there but lost it since I was dealing with a loss and went into a spiral with drinking and using, basically was homeless on the streets hotel hoping with strangers with al my luggage. Got into drugs heavily (been clean now though for a month, woo) and I woke up in the hospital one day in Oakland don\u2019t know what happened or if I was raped or where my belongings went. (I think I was robbed and drugged out heavily)so my parents finally realize what happened to me, flew me back home. Even before being in California, my life was the same so it isn\u2019t about moving back issues. I actually wish I was homeless again there than to be living with my useless mom and asshole brother. You can tell how bitter I was to willingly pack and drive away 4 days across the country. That\u2019s the hate. My brother had his friend move into the house this past weekend and he doesn\u2019t do shit. He eats my food, drinks my own alcohol, smokes my cigs. Everything is toxic here. Sorry but Does anyone around this house realize what I was thru this year? On the street and OD, woke up in the hospital all alone no family to help me, arrested and thrown into a crazy house yet again after my hospitalization (was in there for a week with the weirdest roommate who scared me was scared to even sleep) . Parents not around to answer the phone calls I made and the hospital was like who the fuck is this girl and where is the support from a family member? Yea, it was that bad. So, now here I am back home. Sitting in my dark room typing you all this sad life story. Do I want to end it? Well, yea. But, as everyone says, I am scared to. If I could love anyone out of my family, it\u2019s my dad. He really does care and call me daily to check in on me. We hung out yesterday. I wouldn\u2019t want my dad to walk in on me dead. But I don\u2019t fucking care if my mom or brother did, I would be happy that they saw me. I just really feel stuck and trapped in a huge fucking hole and being around no love no support no hugs no attention. No friends I can stay with to get out of this mess either \n",

            "selftext": "I'm afraid I may have used up my support resources.\n\nFor a few years I've been on and off with fantasies of suicide. When these thoughts hit me, I'm so emotional and vulnerable to hasty decisions that I end up finally reaching out to my mom, sis, or good friend.\n\nMy younger sister is thoroughly worried so I'd rather not bother her with this. I'm sure my mom thinks I'm wanting attention so I avoid her. The friend has been too patient to deserve me whining in his ear any longer. I'm always scared to answer honestly when my psychiatrist brings it up and I stopped going to therapy because my schedule is too tight. Finally, I am petrified of calling one of those hotlines...I feel stuck now like I have to keep quiet and hope for the best.",

            "selftext": "I'm here. Just like everyone else.  I fucking hate my life,  i hate everyone that tells me to \"cheer up\" or to just \"get over it, that's life\", or the absolute worst \"is what it is\"!   \n\n\n\nHere's the meat of the story though.  Ive been dumped tonight.  I saw it coming,  i can't deny that.  But the fact that I've driven someone very sweet to the point that they don't even want me in their life anymore!? Fuck me.    \n\n\n\nI feel like such a waste of space.  I should have a family by now.  All my friends have their happy lives...wait... Friends?  No. People i used to know.  The person that just dumped me like a piece of old food, that was my friend, my absolute BEST friend.   \n\n\n\nWhat did i do?  Welp.  I'm depressed. I have anxiety.  I have the hardest time motivating myself for even the most exciting of times.  I know!  What a fucking downer!  Why would anyone want me!?   \n\n\n\nI'm so beyond average that i swear people forget i even exist (besides my parents,  they are a default, they don't even count right now,  so don't go there). I can't even meet people because i feel like I'm awkward and not intriguing, or \"cool\".   \n\n\n\nI've worked so hard at all of my \"hobbies\" or done things that seem to make people think that I'm so \"talented\", yet when it comes to using those \"talents\" they are NEVER GOOD ENOUGH!   \n\n\n\nMy job is a great job,  and i like to think i make a good dollar, but how the fuck do people live in this world?  I'm looking at places to live cause i splint rent with my SO and Holy shit,  i just want to cry,  take a drink,  and hang myself.   \n\n\n\nI don't understand this world. I don't see the anything that's worth it right now. It's all consumerism. It's all who's hot and who's not.  It's everyone acting like they're on a fucking reality show.  It's all facebook, and twitter.  Its all... Fucking....pointless.     \n\n\n\nI just feel like the people around me would be better off if i wasn't around anymore, but that would be a joke,  nobody notices me anyways,  and those that do,  just push me out of their lives anyways, and move on as if I was a mosquito that they swatted away.  And that's it.    \n\n\n\nI've been on this planet for 35 years,  and ive contributed nothing, but annoyance,  and disappointment.  One of my good friends passed away not long ago, not sure but i think it was suicide.  My friends life got pretty dark in the end.  I felt angry,  and jealous when i heard they had passed.  What kind of feelings are those?  I mean, i bawled my eyes out,  but I'm not sure if that was just the shock.    \n\n\n\nI've been told I'm completely emotionless, but I've been told I'm charming and funny.  I just don't like people to see me cry.  How could i be emotionless and unsympathetic? I just don't know what to say to people.  I cry at movies,  i cry if I'm feeling down.  I want to cry now,  but i can't.    \n\n\n\nI don't want to go to work tomorrow.  I don't want to work anymore.  At all.  I just want to sit and think and listen to music that reminds me of being young, before I new how shitty this world really is.  Before i gave a fuck about what anyone else thought of me.    \n\n\n\nWhy was i the fastest sperm?  It's not like i remember trying. I like to think that my dad just drank too much and only had the one swimmer left,  that way i don't have to think how wonderful one of the others would have turned out.  Me... Why me?  I was even premature,  i should have fucking died.  But no.  I'm here,  and all i have to offer is my presence... Yay... Lucky you.    \n\n\n\nIn closing,  if anyone even stuck around to read this.  I would like to die,  but not some crazy long term death,  and not a random one.  Oh no.  Anxiety has already made me think about those scenarios way too much.  So much that I'm still paying the medical bills.  No.  I want to die on my own terms.  Tonight.  Fuck this.  Goodnight moon.  ",

            "selftext": "I wouldn't call myself depressed. My suicidal thoughts developed somewhat slowly, first starting about three years ago, as I began to realize that there was no point to my life. I'm not religious and don't believe in any afterlife to live for. I have no useful skills and nothing to really offer the world. I feel like I don't have any ability to do something worthwhile with my life, so why continue? As I came to all these realizations, I further discovered that I am, in general, a terrible person, for a variety of reasons that I won't discuss. When I think carefully about all this, it seems logical that I kill myself. The closest I've come was in late January of this year, when I researched and decided on my method of choice. The main reason I have not done it yet is the guilt I feel over how it will affect my parents. I know it would really mess them up, especially my mom. They would probably blame themselves and not understand why I did it. Other than them though, there is not much keeping me here. I only have a few friends, and I think they would get over my death quickly, so that's not an issue. \n\nAfter reading a lot of the posts on this subreddit, I feel even guiltier that I want to kill myself. Many of the people here have been through some difficult, traumatic things. Nothing like that has happened to me. I turn 20 in a month. I have the large majority of my life still ahead of me. I've been given every advantage in life thus far. In fact, when I told a friend about some of these feelings, she said \"Jack, what do you have to be sad about? Your life is perfect.\" And, while nobody's life is perfect, her point is still valid. There's no reason for me to feel this way, and yet I do. I don't look forward to the rest of my life at all. I see it as a chore that I have to muddle through for the sake of my parents. I often fantasize about throwing myself in front of the cars that speed by as I walk back from class. I would never do that, of course, since it would damage their car, and I'm also worried that I might survive it. When I do go through with this, I am going to make sure that there is no doubt. \n\nI suppose that is all for now. I don't really know why I posted here, as I am not looking for anything specific from all of you. It is unlikely that I do anything drastic for at least a couple of months. Thank you for reading this anyway, though. Have a good night.",

Recently I\u2019ve had a lot of chronic health issues from my doctor mismanaging my medication. It\u2019s been almost 3 months that I\u2019ve been dealing with chronic issues. I don\u2019t really want to get into the list of what I\u2019m suffering from some severe medication induced GERD (it wasn\u2019t there before I stared an antibiotic I was prescribed weeks ago) and I basically can barely keep any food down . I\u2019m maybe able to eat 500 calories a day. comfortably or go on longer than 10 minute walks with my dog which is really upsetting to me. I\u2019m in so mush discomfort I\u2019m barely present. On Friday my doctor prescribed me my third of a kind of the same type of medication. All three have left me wheezing and gasping for air. I\u2019m honestly afraid to try the next medication he\u2019s going to prescribe me. I don\u2019t really have access to any different doctors. I\u2019m disabled and So I\u2019m on Medicaid insurance and  the healthcare system where I live is fucking terrible. I\u2019ve talked to staff members about my issues and they don\u2019t seem to take me seriously. I even asked for a referral to a gastroenterologist and my doctor insisted I instead try a gluten free diet and didn\u2019t give me a referral. So that\u2019s the situation I\u2019m in. I\u2019m not getting better and I\u2019m becoming more and more afraid to take my doctor\u2019s advice. It\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve been in objectively worse situations but this is absolutely the lowest I\u2019ve ever been in my life. I\u2019m self harming almost ever day and I just don\u2019t care about being alive anymore. It feels like all I do is suffer at this point. I wish I could say that I don\u2019t have a plan but I do...I\u2019m barely holding on here. I feel like  I\u2019m going crazy. The psych wards here are a living nightmare because there is a huge homelessness problem where I live-so that\u2019s not an option. I really just want to kill myself. I really do-I have a boyfriend and a dog and that was always enough to stop me from acting on suicidal thoughts before but I just don\u2019t care anymore. I just want to stop suffering. Sorry if any part of this post was confusing or rambling.",

And despite how much I loved her, I still felt at times that it was annoying to hear all of the problems that she saw in the world. \nNow I am the one with depression. I told a few of my very close friends that I was diagnosed, so I could explain why I would sometimes go missing. However, during my low periods, I often want to talk to a friend, but I'm so scared of reaching out to them even though they said they wanted to help. I'm afraid that if I were to truly talk to them about my negative feelings it would put a huge burden on them. I'm also afraid that I would sound like I was trying to get attention by portraying myself as this typical poor little girl suffering from depression.\nHave any of you had friends with depression and how does it feel like when they talk about their struggles to you? Or how should I talk to my friends about my problems, if I should even talk to them at all?",

            "selftext": "Today I read \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten better, I\u2019ve just gotten better at hiding it\u201d. After her another suicide attempt and countless drunk nights I got an OWI. Everyone asked if I had a problem, if I was an alcoholic , if I was ever going to get my life together at 22 years old. Not once did anyone ask if I was happy, because, well there\u2019s no way that I was visibly happy. Or maybe I looked \u201cokay\u201d to others. The truth is that I\u2019m not okay, I just put my suicide attempts on hold. I tried viewing the world from a different lens so to speak. I tried being more positive, changed my thoughts about certain things that would happen before my eyes, and even read books on how to \u201chelp\u201d myself. Until the other day I realized that I\u2019m not any better , I don\u2019t feel any less depressed, I still feel empty. Just a 6 foot tall pile of garbage. Everyday that goes by just proves to me that I don\u2019t want to be here. I know i can\u2019t control people, or their behaviors, nor do i try to. But more than anything to i just wish one singular thing could just go right for once. I just lay here doing my deep breathes to try to focus and I feel, well nothing. I feel nothing, but at the same time I feel everything. All of the disappointment I\u2019ve incurred , or all of the things that just inevitable cause me to feel so empty and like life isn\u2019t worth living. The truth is , I\u2019m not a bad person, or an alcoholic. But it made the days pass a little quicker and gave me a little more courage to go through with what I want to do. I want to die, I have felt ready for so long that it feels like parts of me are already dead on their own. As if I played no part of it, but the world around me has killed off pieces of me in preparation for walking me down the aisle to marry death. My first attempt at suicide was almost 5 years ago, and I\u2019ve prepared my method and a detailed letter already. I\u2019m just counting down the days, hoping that some higher power shows me a greater meaning before i reach the day I\u2019ll finally do it. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m scared, it\u2019s that I want to feel, something that isn\u2019t just \u201c a flash in the pants\u201d. I need something that will last longer than beach ball at a nickleback concert. I just keep getting let down and feeling less and less. I can feel myself withering away into nothing due to lack of sleep, and even more of a lack of wanting to be alive. I\u2019m a time bomb, I\u2019ve taken everything one day at a time and every other cliche time reference about waiting, I\u2019ve slapped a smile and a couple witty jokes at a time on my face just to pass by time , but in the end the experiment will always yield the same result. Every time I begin to feel something it leaves before I can take steps to make it last. This will be my last post on here. My last post anywhere. I\u2019m ready to not feel like this . I\u2019m ready for pleasant darkness if that\u2019s what the afterlife brings, or im ready to burn in Hell. Whichever is where i end up, I\u2019ve come to terms with. Anything is better than feeling empty, then full, just to watch the gas evaporate from the tank. ",

            "selftext": "A year after my closest friend hung himself, I am still trying to make sense of it. I think I will never understand why he left. I try to imagine that even though he made the decision, and hung himself that maybe he realized he actually wanted to live. Yet I don't want to think that he suffered even for a second when he did it. I have read that usually a person becomes unconscious within seconds. I only wish he realized he didn't actually want to die because he was very loved by lots of people. I hope he knew he was  truly loved and mattered to all of his friends. \nLots of people had tried to help him along the way. I did everything in my power and understanding to help him. We were such great friends and hung out almost everyday. He told me that both his parents and his brother sexually abused him. His parents were divorced when he was little. His dad and brother used to beat him up all the time. I know all that abuse messed him up really bad. \nHe was such an amazing person. He was awesome! People usually adored him. He smiled so much and made everyone laugh. Sometimes he had these angry outbursts out of nowhere. I felt like it was because of all the abuse he had gone through and tried to love him through thick and thin.\nHe had attempted 3 weeks prior, that time he cut his neck. He lived with his father and brother and they never got him help. I just cant understand it. He asked me to take him to a doctor after the first attempt I did, and they hospitalized him for 9 days. During that time I let his brother know that he had been admitted to the hospital for the suicide attempt. The troubling thing is that his family never visited him in the hospital. They could have gone to see him on the visiting days. I let them know that they could come...but they were just mad at him and mad at me. Once he was released from the hospital and returned home to his dad and brother, he no longer was going to work. Which was totally understandable, but i think being home alone all day just depressed him more and and not even two weeks later, he hung himself. The only reason I found out was when I went to visit him, the neighbor lady came out of her house and told me he had died. I never would have known if it wasn't for her. His family was awful to him when he was alive, and still were awful after he died. They didn't have a funeral for him at all. They told me to disappear when I sent a message telling them my condolences. They actually accused me of hurting him until the police and coroners report declared his death a suicide. I have had no closure. I lost my life when he died. I am slowly trying to put it all in a peaceful corner of my heart and build my life back. I wonder if anyone else has experienced anything like this with the family of someone who killed them self. Or how did you put your life back together?? I have four different plans if I decide to suicide too. I never used to feel like suicide was an option, but this has changed my life 100%. I lost my job 6 weeks after he died. Then my cat died.... it has all been so depressing. I lost everything in less than a year. I never saw all this coming. I finally decided to adopt another cat so I'd have a reason to live...I know it sounds silly, but the cat i adopted was a rescue from the humane society. But actually the cat has rescued me.",

            "selftext": "Hello, first of all I\u2019m not a native speaker of English so sorry if there are a lot of mistakes during the text, And I really don\u2019t have anything planned, I just wish that someone could hear what\u2019s going on with me.\nSo, I\u2019ve found about this subreddit last week, I used to only read few topics about games on reddit from time to time but never really wanted to reply a topic or doing one. But after acknowledging about this subreddit, I wanted to make a topic about what is going on with me on daily basis and seek for help.\nI can\u2019t say exactly for how long I\u2019ve been depressed, sometimes I feel I was born with it, I remember when I was a child I was constantly mocked in school for being ugly and often people used to make fun of the way I speak, my voice etc. And often my parents used to yell at me for not standing people mocking me and they also used to and still mocking me for stuff I do. \nI often say I\u2019ve grew up inside a bubble where the world was something nice to live in, but that bubble blew up when I was like 7 years old and my parents did nothing about it. It was just like I was abandoned. \nI\u2019ve had moments in life which I enjoyed doing things, and moments where I can remember I wasn\u2019t sad but, I\u2019ve never been truly happy. I don\u2019t think I ever experienced happiness even once in life. Since 2014 my life seems to be only going down and down and getting worse every year.\nSince I used to be mocked, not only on school but on classes I used to go with other people, I\u2019m really shy and introvert because I\u2019m always afraid that people will say bad things to me again like they did in the past. My parents most of the time don\u2019t accept the fact I\u2019m an introvert and keep saying \u201cyou can\u2019t be introvert, there is no place for introvert people in the labor market\u201d and don\u2019t even try to understand me.\nDue to my introversion I tend to be quiet in places and very avoidant of people, if someone try to talk with me I try to cut the conversation and bring it to an end as fast as I can (I rarely have interest in talk with people in daily basis). And I also tend to do activities which I can be only me and the teacher in the room (like piano classes, I tried to do a Japanese class with other people but, I often was sad and I don\u2019t feel like demonstrating it to people around me but I was so tired to fake it that I just dropped due to that and kinda still studying in home).  \nMost of the friends I had where done in the internet or my old class. In 2012 I changed school with one of my few friends at the time and I met new people in a new classroom and they were something like friends to me if I can say, I had one friend that used to be moving himself a lot through the city I live so he had studied in a lot of schools and met lot of people, so my friends in 2013 and 2014 were these guys.\nIn 2013, even tho it was like the least worse year I had in all my life, It was when the irl friends I had used to point out that I was a failure, I wasn\u2019t good at nothing and so on. In 2014 was the year which I\u2019ve had few complications due to some problems I was facing at time (I\u2019ll refrain from writing about it because everything was already solved) but at that time I met what was my first best friend, a girl that could notice I was quiet, avoidant of people and unhappy with life and decided to talk with me, it was hard for her in the beginning but one day I just couldn\u2019t stand faking being alright and wrote what I was feeling. I used to talk with her all the morning and afternoon by some sort of \u201cirl chats\u201d (I really prefer to write rather than talk because I really hate the way my voice sounds like and I often get nervous when talking with people) but then she had to change school in 2015 and her parents found out some stuff she was doing in 2014 and she had no internet in the whole 2015 because of that. \nIn 2015, my irl friends started to be real assholes with me for no reason, some of them used to mock at me, and I\u2019m not someone that get pissed and start raging out everything, I don\u2019t feel like rage most of the times, but after stuff I just couldn\u2019t stand anymore and rage everything on me, and then they just started saying to me: \u201cwhy did you do that? Are you fucking crazy or what?\u201d they never tried to see my side of the story and used to constantly offend me for no reason at all.\nAfter the year of 2015, in the early 2016 I was feeling like a real trash for a bunch of shit happening in my life, at 2016 my best friend had return so I just talked with her about my feeling of being a trash and we just started talking like old times. A lot of shit happened in 2016 and that had an impact on my personality. I moved from where I live to a city where I didn\u2019t know anybody and I was simply alone. And my irl friends at the time would still mock me as a \u201cfag\u201d and other stuff. I only had like 2 friends on the internet that I used to talk to at the time that lived far from me, I used to talk with them because at the time I just felt everybody had someone more special than me in their lives, except for these two, I wasn\u2019t the most special person for them, but they didn\u2019t had one either so I used to talk with them and searching for new friends on the internet, but everybody I tried to talk to on the internet seemed to ignore me and I don\u2019t know why.\nBy the end of 2016, Me and my best friend had an argue because of some stuff I was doing the whole year and it had a huge impact on me, some friends of mine tried to help me out but they just went into the argue and start bashing me even more but somehow everything got solved, but by that moment, me and my best friends were no longer \u201cbesties\u201d anymore, Every time I tried to talk with her she used to reply like I was annoying her. So, after all that I met a guy on the internet that heard everything that happened with me from 2014 to 2016, and we started talking a lot and I started knowing other peoples and suddenly, I was seeing myself with friends, in early 2017 I moved back to where I used to live and I had like new friends everything. I was feeling I would now have a happy life (by the way, I used to have a crush on one guy from that group, and we kinda had a bromance back then if I can say so). But on April everything seemed to be over, the guy which I had a bromance with just dumped me and I just went back to my usual sadness at the time, I still tried to be his friend but he often would cut our chats as fast as he could and I was just depressed. On April, I also met a girl that later on became my best friend (and the only friend I have nowadays) and then a lot of stuff happened by 2017, and most of the friends I used to have just leaved me for no reason.\nAlso by 2017 in like May, there was a girl on my class that we had a lot of interests in common and we talked from time to time, and, even tho I almost don\u2019t know a lot about her, I\u2019m in love with her (I think I fall in love with people easily, you guys can bash me if you want). But, I\u2019m very shy and I can\u2019t talk with her in real life and she\u2019s often talking with other people that scare me.  I used to try talking with her through internet but even on the internet, she takes long time for replying messages and often she doesn\u2019t even reply. I once asked her if I did something that offended her and if she hates me and she said that \u201cI don\u2019t hate you. You\u2019re someone very kind and cool.\u201d And she doesn\u2019t seem to be annoyed by me the few times we talked to each other in real life (and she was always very kind with me). But, I don\u2019t think that she was saying me the truth to be honest. \nBy early this year, I was believing (and still do) she hates me, all the friends I did on the internet left me by the beginning of the year. Most of them left me because they didn\u2019t knew how to deal with me. I\u2019m someone that is kinda hard to deal with, my humor swings a lot in a spam of hours, and I tend to talk a lot about things I\u2019m passionate for and explain concepts for people. But, everyone got mad at me saying \u201cyou treat me like I\u2019m some sort of retarded\u201d and I used to talk with them about the pain I was feeling, but they all said I was crazy and had no reason to suffer or to love her at all etc. So I only had one friend (my best friend) and some people which I talk to very often sometimes but I don\u2019t talk with them about my problems because they don\u2019t seem to want to hear it (and I don\u2019t want to talk with them about my problems either). So, even with everything I feel, I often try to help everyone I care for, just like my best friend. So she tried to help me (Forgot to say that she is kinda \u201cfriend\u201d of the girl I love but not close friend). \nI did a playlist for this girl with some songs that described the feelings I had for her and my friend sent it to her (we tried to make it in a way she didn\u2019t knew it was me who was sending the playlist and a way that my friend didn\u2019t sound like a lesbian) and she listened to it and said: \u201cI understand what he means with it, unfortunately, at the moment I\u2019m not looking to have a relationship with anyone, I know it\u2019s frustrating but it\u2019s the true, but I still wanna be his friend, he seems someone very nice!\u201d she also said \u201csometimes I don\u2019t reply people but it\u2019s not because I hate them or stuff like that, it\u2019s because I forgot to check my messages and etc\u201d. \nSince then, I\u2019m not seeing reasons to be alive anymore. I had a \u201cfriend\u201d that was close to her (the girl I love) and knew I loved her, and when I talked to her about what happened she said that \u201cit\u2019s over\u201d. However, a friend I had on the last month (that left me) said that \u201cshe didn\u2019t said \u201cI don\u2019t want to date with him\u201d she said \u201cat the moment I\u2019m not looking for relationships\u201d.\u201d  However I really don\u2019t know.  My humor is gone, I have no motivation at all nowadays for doing what I used to like (playing games for example) and everyday I just feel something inside me on my chest, like an ice, a huge ice, and it hurts.\nI really hate the way I look, I see everybody near me as \u201cbetter than me\u201d in terms of appearance, I hate my body, I hate my hair, I hate my voice,  My grades get worse by years and my parents just yell at me saying I\u2019m a failure and only school matters in my life etc,  My dream job is to be one day a professional pianist, but I suck at piano, I\u2019m not good at it, and I\u2019m not even a child prodigy. I spent all my childhood in \u201cthe bubble\u201d only watching tv, eating junk food, sleep and doing nothing more.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever achieve my goal to be a world class pianist, and I think I\u2019ll die alone with no friends, and the girl I love hates me and even if I try to be her friend (which seems impossible to me since I can\u2019t get close to her in real life and internet) she would never love me and find someone better than me. My best friend has people that she likes more than me and she is probably finding the love of her life while I\u2019m alone , two friends I did this year left me and said I was \u201csick\u201d \u201cmental\u201d etc, My parents don\u2019t understand me at all and get mad at me for staying late in the computer and having bad grades on school,  I don\u2019t feel my heart beating anymore when I put my hand over my chest, and this weekend some people I thought were friendly to me just mocked my mental problems. I can\u2019t seek for professional help because my parents wouldn\u2019t take me serious, I tried to talk with a suicide hotline but I got nervous, and every day I\u2019m more unmotivated to do things I like.  I\u2019ve attempted suicide a bunch of times, but I\u2019m a coward that can\u2019t even cut himself.  I really don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be alive next year.\nIf you read everything, even if you don\u2019t say anything, thank you for reading the cry of a lost soul...\n",

            "selftext": "TL;DR: I'm at a point in life where I don't even know what I need to do, how I need to do it. It feels like my entire life is being wasted and I don't have the mental energy to keep going on\n\nSo where the fuck do I begin. I got no bloody idea. Lets just go trough the timeline I guess\n\nI was born in Canada, in a poor family, with a( at the time) violent, depressed father and a bordeline mother. Along the childhood we  moved.... I honestly lost track how many time honestly.... from Montreal, Laval, Ottawa, Gatineau.... Basically destroying any chance of truly understanding how to form a proper social network and how to socialize because I just kept moving so fucking much it was basically pointless to try since you'd lose contact right after... I digress. Point being we moved a lot.\n\nMost of my social interactions that I did manage to get were stale and bland, mixed with a sprinkle of absolute psychotic. Most happening in school, because fuck me if anyone ever invited me to anything ever after school, People usually had one of the two thoughts about me: \"He's weird asf\" or \"He's annoying asf\" pick and choose. So obviously I spend most of my elementary, middle and high school doing pretty much the same shit alone. Alone being the key part. I've done a lot of personality test and introversion tests and its clear that, although being ambivert, I'm extroverted dominant. Reason I say this is sometime I need social interaction. I got everything I could of wanted, except that. In the end I'm starting to think people will all succeed because of just that: they got friend henceforth they got potential life opportunities. I got none of that. Now I know I've been rambling pretty much this entire time but I had to ramble somewhere and this subreddit seemed a decent candidate. But then again I doubt myself so fucking much all the time because intelligence is the only mildly attractive quality I may posses. So of course when my intellect is challenge I start dying inside because my validation that I'm a human piece of garbage with no assets to call his own. \n\nI'm poor, weird, ostracized to absolute shit, have depression, Asperger syndrome, Atrial septum defect, low blood pressure, Probably malnutrition because, again, were poor.\n\nI'm not even sure how to turn my life around if it's even possible. I'm to tired to search, yet I don't wanna die. I just wanna cease existing, if that makes sense. I want people to forget I ever existed so I can just disapeared.\n\nAnd If anyone blames my behavior on my depression, don't; I know. Thing is, its not as simple as going to a clinic where I live; I've been waiting for years in a stupid waiting list and I still only got a psychologist who can at most prescribe me stupid fucking ssris that dont work, I was on Prozac when I was a kid and I didn't work back, now they put me on sertraline (zoloft) and I guess that didn't do its job either\n\nSo yeah. Im done, im going to bed. I hope I don't wake up.\n\n\nPS: This was originally going to be posted on /r/offmychest but when I realized I couldn't even do that, this subreddit seemed to fit the bill.\n\n\"This is the place to unload that baggage that's been weighing you down for days, weeks, months, or years.\" \n offmychest\n\nUnless you're me. If you're me you can fuck off mate.",

            "selftext": "There's that Chinese curse that goes \"May you find what you are looking for.\" This saying is a curse disguised as a blessing. Said unto others as not to generate bad karma or juju for the person who speaks it.\n\nI have this problem--nothing can hold my interest. Everything and everyone is temporary.  My hobbies/interest stick for a few months or so until I inevitablly burn out of it and am left in this void of boredom. Bored of my hobbies, bored of my stagnant relationship, bored of my predictable family, no desire for schooling that my parents pay for even though it's the only thing in my  life currently that holds purpose. Boredom strikes hard; it's a mental pain for me that manifests itself as physical discomfort. \n\nI think of how bored I am now and how long it will be until I find another stimulus. Sometimes that gap is too long. Sometimes there's something for me but it's too inconvenient for me to bother. \n\nI've always found that happiness isn't my priority. I'll volunteer to work 55 hours a week because, logically, I'd those extra 15 hours would be me just playing video games (considered to be the lowest level of productivity) so why not just work instead and claim the time and a half?\n\nEventually I'll be working a sallary job (in the engineering field) fighting to find things that hold my interest for the little time I have after work. I don't like engineering, I'm just good at it. \n\nI thought about doing drugs. I smoke weed occasionally but feel guilty when I do because I should be doing school work instead. I don't like drinking, I don't like the crowd of people who like drinking. I don't like people that like what I like because I usually find that I'm more intelligent than them and they don't impress me or interest me in the slightest. I'm lonely by my own accord.\n\nI thought about cheating on my girlfriend for fun because she's boring too but couldn't bring myself to crush someone like that. Even sadness and anger are more interesting than being bored.\n\nI would leave this lifestyle and move to a different country but it would be stupid of me to turn down paid for schooling and living. My parents would be disappointed in me for years and I'm sure I would be disappointed in me too.\n\nDoes it ever end? I'm scared I'll be bored forever. I'm jealous of people that can suck at things and be happy. I jealous people that can find everything interesting. I'm jealous of people that can be happy with nothing.\n\nI sit here in my expensive apartment with paid for school a nice paying internship on the track of my schooling. I'm a pretty good looking guy with some sort of charisma, no health problems and all I have is complaints and negativity and I can't stop. I just want to be happy but I don't think it's ever going to happen. I've never been happy with status quo. I'm always looking to the future for a higher point but it's dark.\n\nI don't want to talk to anyone about it because I don't want them to think less of me. Even more so, I don't want them to know what I think of them. I don't want to be the guy that \"needs emotional help.\" That's just more baggage. As much as we wish people won't look at us different when they know we're this miserable. They do, we do. I do.",

            "selftext": "Hi, \n\nI've never posted on here before, but I did something recently that has been haunting me more than anything in my life. I'm a socially awkward guy in my first year of college. I'm overweight, anti\\-social, and basically everything else to make for a bad concoction when trying to talk to girls. I was really discouraged my first semester and I just hated being here, and yet this semester things started to clear up. There was a girl from last semester that was in my psychology class that I oddly liked for some reason. I hadn't even talked to her that much but I just had an odd attraction to her and I would try to at least say hi whenever I could. We ended up studying for one of our exams together and I loved talking to her and getting to know her. She said she had anxiety and depression, so I knew that early on. I have depression too, so it wasn't hard to relate. However, we didn't talk much after that until after winter break. \n\nWhen we came back for the following semester, I saw her a couple times at a distance and said hi, but then there was a point where I didn't see her for a couple weeks, so I mustered some courage and texted her one night. I said that I hadn't seen her for a while and hoped everything had been going well. She told me to come over to her room so we could catch up, and there she told me that she had actually been in the psych ward because she said she was suicidal so they committed her, but now she is finally on medication for her anxiety and depression. In the conversation, I brought up how I was going to a frat party that night, and she said she could come if I wanted her to. So I invited her back to my room to drink a bit before, and she got drunker than I expected. There was no way she could have gone to the party, but she had so little that I thought there was no way she was as drunk as she was acting. I got buzzed too and started talking to her about how I actually texted her because I always kind of liked her. She had a boyfriend and cheated on him regularly. And, me being a dick of course, looked past that. She pulled me into her and started kissing me for a long time, but I refused to do anything else because she was drunk. She ended up falling asleep for about an hour and getting up and leaving after apologizing for being too drunk. \n\nShe texted me the next day saying she had a good time and she didn't regret it. The next week was spring break and we texted and facetimed a lot, and I loved it. I loved talking to her and I wanted it to continue. During that week, she sent me a couple nudes and had sexual conversations with me. So the day we got back from break, I invited her over again to see what she wanted to do. I got really nervous about it so I started drinking which was so incredibly stupid. I regret it more than anything. When she got there with some homework she planned on doing, I started kissing her and she pushed me away and asked me how drunk I was, and she got uncomfortable and said she had a boyfriend and she had just been thinking that day about how she's going to stay loyal to him. I backed off and just talked to her for a little bit, she kept asking me if I was getting sober, and I was definitely not as drunk as when she walked in. She then asked me if she could drink, and after last time I cautioned her to not drink as much. She drank about half as much as last time and right after she finished her drink she said she was drunk. When she started trying to do stuff again, I said I wouldn't if she was drunk. So, she kept saying that she was just acting drunk because she didn't want to feel as guilty about cheating. I gave into that lie and made out with her and I ended up fingering her. She wanted to have sex but the alcohol mixed with the nervousness wouldn't let me get hard. She said it was okay and ended up leaving. The next day I texted her and she replied saying she felt violated. I had a panic attack when I read it and was more scared than I ever have been. She said she was going to keep it between us and she wants us to move on, but that week was dreadful. I didn't want to get out of bed, school work took me forever to do because I couldn't focus, and I sunk into the worst depression of my life to date. It's been about a month since that night, and I'm definitely not as depressed as I was, but I still think about it and her every day. We still snapchat, but nowhere near how we once did. I have talked to her several times apologizing and telling her that I have never been more ashamed of myself and how when I said I cared about her I still treated her like I did and that I couldn't live with myself. She said she forgave me and that she would be okay, but nothing felt right. \n\nThis past week, I talked to her again. I said I missed talking to her and that I still couldn't get over the shame. She said she told her boyfriend about it a couple of weeks ago because she was shaken and upset and felt guilty for cheating on him. She said he didn't want her around me for good reason and that she did not feel comfortable around me yet, and that things take time. Regardless of that, she facetimed me and talked and then ended up coming over to my room and talking to me. I told her how I started attending counseling and that I couldn't stop thinking about her and about how ashamed I was at how I had treated her. She was more than caring about it and said that she will be okay and that I just need to learn how to forgive myself. She said that everything will be okay and that I can be happy again. She tricked me into apologizing to her boyfriend by walking me to where he was, but when I talked to him he was nicer than I could ever picture someone being in that situation. He said he understands what alcohol does and that it makes people do things they would never do normally. And yet I still feel this absolute shame and self\\-hatred for what I did. Part of it is because I know that it still bothers this girl, but she said a lot of stuff to make me feel better and to take my attention off of her. She even started crying at one point that night about it and I felt my heart sink. At first, I was scared beyond belief that she was going to report me to the school for what happened and my parents would be let down and ashamed of me. And then, when she said she would keep it between us and that she just wanted me to learn from it, I still feel absolutely ashamed of myself. Counseling hasn't even been working that well, but it has helped somewhat. When I get upset about it and apologize she tells me to calm down and that she is fine and I will be too. Why can't I believe her? Why do I feel this constant shame still? I was so wrong in what I did, and yet I can't even move on as well as she can and she was the victim here. I still care about her and just can't take the shame of knowing that I ruined things with someone I actually liked talking to. I have such problems meeting people and forming relationships, and I often feel like no one cares about me. I thought I had finally found one, and I absolutely destroyed it. And that makes me feel more ashamed of myself than I have ever felt. I don't know what to do, I don't know what more there is to say, I don't know what other closure I can get, I just know that the weight of this is driving me to worse depths than I thought imaginable. How do I move on from this? How do I see myself as worthy of living again? Because right now, I see myself as absolutely despicable and not even kind of deserving of life. Even when the very girl I assaulted tells me I'm worthy and that I can be happy, that's not enough. I just need some peace with this all. ",

            "selftext": "My husband of 7 years made an attempt almost two weeks ago after a (what seems to me like a) rapid 2 week spiral but he said he was hiding if for a few months.  He's currently physically well, staying in a mental health ward, starting to seem like his old self again and he says he's feeling better.  When I had a family conference it didn't seem like they wanted him to stay much longer and are forced on moving to outpatient care.  He's been given more and more privileges I think the end of inpatient is near. \n\nAlthough he has a history of suicidal depression,  the last bout of it was well before my time so this is new to me.  He hasn't wanted anyone to be told about this so I've been dealing on my own although some people at work know because it's impacted my work a bit. \n\nI have an awkward problem I dunno how to work through.   \n\nWe have a trip to Hawaii booked a week from today.  First week was to be a romantic getaway for us and the second week he was to come home and I had to stay for work.  At one point a source of excitement, now this whole thing is awkward and overwhelming and I don't know how to handle it. \n\nFor the record, the work part in two weeks is not optional.  Getting outta it jeopardizes my job (I'm the only bread winner right now).  The romantic getaway is optional. \n\nIf he's out,  should I actually be thinking of traveling with him?  Would it help his recovery to be in a calm beautiful place?  Or make him worse because he's not really around outpatient resources or routine?  How do I handle him alone for a week when he was suppose to fly home and be alone?\n\nIf he remains an inpatient,  what do I do?  He wants me to go without him (but this also was said when he still planned to not be alive at that point) but I wouldn't want the optional part away from him because it would probably just be sad for me but he struggles with the guilt (lost monitary investments when he's not even working and its already tight and taking away this from me).   What if he's released while I'm away?  No one else knows about this to step up. It feels like I'm abandoning him in an institution.  \n\nAny advice? ",

I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019m either thinking about killing myself or sleeping... This has worked because I\u2019ve been on school holidays, so I could sleep all day and night and be ok, but I start school again tomorrow and I don\u2019t know how to cope, i\u2019ll have to be awake for atleast 10 hours a day and i don\u2019t know what to do. I can not stand being alive, i cant stand being awake. I used to have lots of hobbies ranging from sport to writing but nothing interests me anymore, I don\u2019t have the energy to get out of bed to eat anymore, I don\u2019t have the will to look after myself (shower, brush my hair etc) but I have to change to look normal for school again.

I'm tired. I'm just *fucking* tired. I'm tired to have spend almost every single days in the last 8 years wanting to die. I'm tired of all the hatred towards myself. I'm tired of not being able to connect with others. I'm tired to be excluded. I'm tired of people telling me I shouldn't have problem because I am pretty. I am tired of being an object, of being used. I'm tired of not caring. I'm tired to be a disappointment to my family. I'm tired of letting people down and hurting the ones who try to love me. \n\nBut most of all I am tired of watching my life from far away and being stuck in this parallel universe.

            "selftext": "Three weeks ago, my mod /u/drunkenposting asked whether there were safe havens:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/87krto/your_country_of_residence_if_you_care_to_share/?st=jg1avncd&amp;sh=05de9cb9\n\nApparently, none of the old subscribers remember what they read and the new subscribers do not use Reddit's search engine to find answers. While a mod of /r/gangstalking in 2014 - 2015, I had posted on eluding and on radio free zones:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/38op8d/part_1_why_other_ti_websites_do_not_have/?st=jg1azqox&amp;sh=71bea31f\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/3l2otg/are_non_nato_countries_safe_havens_to_elude_to/?st=jg1b1bxi&amp;sh=84af73ab\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/3niioj/wiki_what_not_to_do_after_successfully_eluding/?st=jg1axnps&amp;sh=08c766fc\n\n/u/drunkenposting disclosed he resides in Virginia:\n\n&gt;I moved to Virginia, so unfortunately I'm still in the DMV area. Much further out, though.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/87krto/your_country_of_residence_if_you_care_to_share/dwfqtfv/?st=jg1auzwq&amp;sh=05eafb5c\n\nThough I rarely have time to read posts in /r/gangstalking any more, I read his post. This saved me from having the regret had I only read his post and replied, I could possibly have saved him. I tried.\n\nI could not comment because /u/pogomaster12, the mod who replaced me, had banned me for requesting performance of Tok-A-Mak's promise to refer. Therefore, I PM /u/drunkenposting. Our PMs are at:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/8cighp/suicided_eluding_radio_free_zones_our_mod/dxf6ldi/?st=jg1e00wq&amp;sh=93c0888c\n\nThe radio free zone in West Virginia is a mere several hour trip by car from Virginia. West Virginia was annexed from Virginia during the Civil War. /u/drunkenposting refusing to drive several hours is exemplary of TIs being self centered and selfish. Yes, the majority of TIs are. \n\nFor over two years, I have been writing radio free zones may be possible safe havens. I have been downsizing to prepare to relocate. For over two years, we have waited for subscribers to follow through. They haven't. Even /u/drunkenposting. \n\nLast year, I invited /u/drunkenposting to mod /r/targetedenergyweapons and /r/electromagnetics. He accepted the invitation but didn't perform any mod duties. I encouraged him to post. He choose to post in his own sub. Own subs act like one's own Facebook. Reddit is not Facebook. \n\nFour days ago, /u/drunkenposting announced being suicide in his own sub but not the other two subs he mods:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/MyTortureJournal/comments/8bmm4n/im_trying_to_commit_suicide_tonight/?st=jg1bnuso&amp;sh=59217209\n\nHad drunkenposting wanted targeted individuals (TIs) to encourage him to live, wouldn't he have posted in other TI subs? Had he wanted to generate publicity of the plight of TIs, wouldn't he have posted in large subs? Or committed suicide in downtown Washington, DC talking into a bull horn and wearing a poster? \n\nI do not subscribe to /r/MyTortureJournal. Two days ago, /u/triscuitzop PM me regretting that he did not see his post in time. Thank you /u/triscuitzop for notifying me. Two nights ago, I logged into Reddit. I was knocked out unconscious for 4 1/2 hours. Last night immediately after I went on a computer, the torturers made me semi conscious. They rendered me incapable of Redditing. \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/87z72d/torture_tactics_brain_zapping_vs_knocked_out/?st=jg1czro7&amp;sh=8e323a6e\n\nI read /u/triscuitzop's notice today, Sunday, April 15, 2018.\n\n/u/triscuitzop's notifying me is not enough. /u/drunkenposting was a subscriber and poster in /r/gangstalking. I request /u/triscuitzop to crosspost my post in /r/gangstalking.\n\nWill someone honor /u/drunkenposting's suicide by checking out the radio free zone next door to his corpse? Plant a tree with a huge memorial sign stating a TI may have possibly survived had they lived here. Submit a meter report. Archive the meter report into wikis. Cite the wikis to answer future TIs questions on safe havens when they haven't bothered to read our wikis.\n\nFailure to read the shielding wikis and to shield contributed to drunkenposting's suicide:\n\n[]from drunkenposting sent 24 days ago\n\n\nTo be honestly I haven't experimented with anything beyond rudimentary shielding yet. I don't really have the money right now to do so, but maybe in the future I'll try it.\n\nI had replied sea salt is a mere $.69 per pound at the health food store. Granular bentonite clay is affordable too. Our PMs on shielding are at:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/8cighp/suicided_eluding_radio_free_zones_our_mod/dxfau8a/?st=jg1oqeul&amp;sh=3be892a4\n\nI hold /u/Tok-A-Mak partially responsible for /u/drunkenposting's suicide. A nonTI should not be the head mod of a TI sub. /u/Tok-A-Mak took over /r/gangstalking in /r/redditrequest. In 2015, he censored directed energy weapons, ultrasound, meter reports, shielding, implants, stasi, etc. and simultaneously without warning demoded five mods including me. /u/Tok-A-Mak recommended we create a sub on the topics he censored. He breached his promise to refer /r/targetedenergyweapons. The mods of /r/gangstalking continue to breach promise:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/79cdf5/closing_rtargetedindividuals_part_2_is_head_mod/?st=jg1diinf&amp;sh=59e91eb8\n\nI had foreseen the consequences of a TI sub censoring directed energy weapons and shielding:\n\n\nAll three mods of /r/gangstalking are complicit in perpetuating physical torture and slow kill.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/78snvc/closing_rtargetedindividuals_please_subscribe_to/dp0rcfc/?st=jg1eixay&amp;sh=2d09b9fb\n\nThough /u/drunkenposting is a mod of /r/targetedenergyweapons and /r/electromagnetics, he neither had read the wikis nor asked for help. He asked for help in /r/gangstalking. A sub that had banned the very topics he needed help in. The subscribers of /r/gangstalking do not read old posts. They are ignorant on what was posted prior to Tok-A-Mak's censorship. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. In this case, ignorance lead to suicide. None of the subscribers have knowledge of this as none of the mods announced the suicide in their own sub.\n\nPractically being the only TI who researches and recommends eluding, radio free zones and shielding on Reddit may have lowered my credibility. Hive mind takes over. The majority don't discuss these topics because they lack knowledge of them. Hive mind wins. Do nothing but bitch. By demodding five mods, /r/ganstalking turned into a chat room.\n\nWe need more mods and subscribers to answer shielding questions by referring the shielding wikis. We need wiki contributors to update the wikis. I cannot keep do it all.\n",

I don't try to take my life actively, is just that if I was in a situation of life or death, I would happily choose death and would hurt everyone that helps me to choose life. My mom refusing to accept I'm transgender doesn't help either, my dysphoria is getting worse and worse and she just says \"Other people had it worse\".\n\nShe isn't helping, she is actually making it worse, I just want to end this, a part of this just pleads, screams, begs to be killed. I'm at risk of getting expel only for my LGBT identity, off-topic but my sister screams and is annoying.\n\nThe only way to cope is escaping to my head and just ignore the reality, making stories in my head.\n\nI just, don't know, my stories might help me, but the pain is getting too much, I told myself I can wait four years till I can have some form of hormonal therapy, but I don't think I will be able to survive, I don't think my dysphoria will leave me until then, I don't think it will leave me alive.\n\nI planned lots of suicide plans, not doing them at last minute for fear of not succeeding, I planned a suicide in my birthday, Twentytwo of May, I'm still deciding in which way I'm going to commit it, I can by death by truck or overdose, I don't know, I want to make it look like an accident, people die all the time, right?\n\nHowever I'm going to send a message to my classmates, \"I'm not going to go to class tomorrow, I'm sick\", if I'm dead by then, and they get the notice, they will know.

Can't escape. I physically can't escape and start to heal.

They might not even know what to do after you tell them. But here is a fact;\n\nThey do not want you dead.\n\nTell them what you need. Forget about feeling like a \"burden,\" _tell them what you need._\n\nLive on, and do whatever you can to live on, no matter how painful it is, no matter the amount of depression you may suffer, and then tell your story of survival, because let me tell you, even if they cannot relate to the extent you are suffering,\n\nSomeone does. \n\nAnd that someone needs to know that they too, are not alone.\n\nAnd when they know they are not alone anymore, and that you've helped them realize that, all of that pain, all of that suffering, it doesn't compare to the amount of comfort you are able to bring that person, even if it is just one person. \n\nIf you are feeling suicidal tonight, please remember the amount of power you have to impact someone else's life, and please remember that there are people, including people you might've not even met yet, that want you to live on.\n",

I was removed from university almost a year ago. My family doesn't know and thinks i'm graduating soon. This is the second time I have done this to my family. I thought I could fix it and I end up getting stuck inside my head without actually doing anything to make the situation better. I have suffered from major depression and have been off and on medication during that time. Sense I started high school, I have felt like a colossal disappointment. I have no interests, hobbies or passions left at this point. Everything I once was has been slowly eroded away. For the last few years I have toyed with the idea of suicide and currently would rather die then tell my family that I lied to them about school again. I can't bring myself to tell my family what I did and want to just fade away at this point. I haven't gotten out of bed in 3 days and have just been looking at a knife beside me just trying to figure out which path is best. I can count the list of people on one hand that would even notice I was gone. I hate what I am now and every time I have tried to change it in recent years it has completely blown up in my face and left me in a worse place than I was before I tried. I just don't know how to fix what I have done at this point. I don't know what i'm looking for here other than for someone to say something. ",

            "selftext": "I've been struggling with thoughts of suicide for about 2 to 3 years now. It started off as a flicker of depression when I was about 17, but it slowly turned from flickers to lasting hours and eventually weeks and months on end. \n\nWhen I was 19, I decided it was time. I spent months rationalizing my decision-- one day I sat for a while, put on my favorite song one last time, and didn't say a single goodbye. This was my only attempt at suicide, and was cut short by images flashing in my head of my younger siblings walking into the bathroom and seeing my body sprawled out and lifeless. \n\nAt 20 now, I feel I can no longer shoulder the pain in fear of hurting my loved ones. I wish I could just be an island; secluded with no relations. I feel as though there's an immense weight on my shoulders to not commit suicide and I simply just want to let go. I find nothing but pain and suffering in my life. The small fleeting moments of happiness completely overshadowed by a baseless depression I can do nothing about. My behavior has been self destructive for quite some time now. I'm failing in school, I almost never seem to leave my room, my personal hygiene has gone out the window. I just don't care anymore. I just want everything to end. I don't want help, I just want everything to stop existing. \n\nThe only problem is my family. It would completely destroy my mother, and knowing the dynamic of my family it would completely tear them apart. I love them very much but cannot bear to ruin their lives because I don't see the point in mine. I wish I could get some uncurable disease like cancer so I would have some type of excuse to part ways with life. \n\nThere was really no point to any of this, but I just needed to get it out so I could soldier on just a little bit longer. For them.",

So much support, hope &amp; acceptance in this community! \nJust fucking kidding, this is where I go to have my suicidal fantasies confirmed. r/SuicideMeme just isn't doing it for me anymore, so here I am. The next level. Stopping to pretend like I'm thinking all of this ironically and admitting that I might actually wan't to clock out early. The real good stuff.\nNow, as you may have been able to tell by the fact that I manage to talk a lot, yet convey pretty much nothing at all, the way to get through to me is covered by multiple layers of comedic exploitation of my own crippling insecurity, soul sapping references, puns and (father forgive me for I have sinned), dare I say, memes.\nSeeing as though I'm 20 y/o, this sort of black-humoring myself has been accumulating within my psyche &amp; self-image for approximately 4 to 6 years, like plaque, clogging a chain-smoking diabetic's arteries. By now this layer should be about as thick as the earth's crust, I wouldn't know though, since I'm not one to go \"once more into the fray\".\nAnd here we are, quoting Shakespeare again. See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. This isn't funny. This isn't fun.\nThis is forced and cringy and edgy and [insert negative adjective here], etc. Worst of all, I know how bad that makes me look. I've known since the beginning.\nSomewhere down the line, probably when I realized that deep down I'm a sad strange little man, someone told me to laugh it off. So I did. AND THEN I NEVER STOPPED. And damn, was I good at it. So good in fact, that I built my whole personality around it. Then that personality started attracting all kinds of people. Suddenly this cynical and disrespectful persona had more friends than the sad strange little man. IRL! So you do what all 16 y/o males gaining status through questionable means do: Try to get laid.\nTurns out you need to be somewhat attractive for casual hookups. Turns out you need to be somewhat like-able for non- casual hookups. So you eventually pry open Pandora's box and see how the strange sad little man is with the ladies. And gosh, what a nice guy he is! Kind, forthcoming, understanding, sooo respectful and most importantly, empathetic! So naturally, he becomes the designated shoulder to cry on.\n\nBe funny and casual -&gt; Be attentive, deep and open -&gt; Establish trust -&gt; Develop feelings -&gt; Get \"friend-zoned\" -&gt; Change Target -&gt; Repeat\n\nThis goes on for some years and...Yada yada yada.\n'Couple half-assed suicide attempts, 3 years of professional dead-end therapy and a metric fuckton of mj later, here we are.\n\nReading what I've written up to this point, you, the reader, should have a pretty good idea of what kind of a pathetic, bitter, beta-male virgin ( Shout-out to my lads over at r/virgin, y'all are the saddest bunch of self-loathing crybabies I've ever seen. Thanks for making me feel right at home.) I am.\nI don't like my humor, but these days, that's all I have. That's all I am. Just one big, overused joke, you've heard a million times before, that has been going on for far too long.\nTime to deliver the punchline.\n\nWhy should I keep going with this farce?\nWould you keep going, if you were me?\nDo you really think I haven't tried to change yet?\nWill I ever stop wasting everyone's precious time and effort and finally grow the balls to take my worthless life?\nFind out next time, on \"r/SuicideWatch: The self-pity party continues\"!\n\n...\u1d3a\u1d52, \u02b3\u1d49\u1d43\u02e1\u02e1\u02b8 \u1d57\u02b0\u1d52\u1d58\u1d4d\u02b0. \u1d3e\u02e1\u1d49\u1d43\u02e2\u1d49 \u02b0\u1d49\u02e1\u1d56 \u1d50\u1d49.",

            "selftext": "This isn't a cry for help, or a plea, an attempt at attention, or even a final note to the world (I hope)...\n\nWe are far beyond that at this point.\n\nMy name is Samuel, born on the 26th day of April, 1991.\n\nWhen I was 14, I noticed that I didn't perceive, nor experience things in the same ways as other teenagers, or adults for that matter. Because of this, throughout my foray into adulthood and beyond, I have always been the easy person to single out; at the same time, I have also learned how to be the chameleon that no one notices.\n\nOne of my friends put it simply: I have the mental and genetic makeup to be a nightmarish serial killer, yet somehow there was a step that was cut short... some action or event that should have occurred, but didn't, leaving the circuit open, so to speak.\n\nI find this both depressing and funny. Truth be told, one of my personal favorite quotes, \"Life is a joke, albeit, a bad joke, but a joke nontheless; learn to roll with the punchlines,\" has become the guideline to my life. I thought...\n\nBack to 14.\n\nBeing ostracized, told you're different, being made fun of, beaten, bruised, thrown down stairwells, framed, laughed at... it's all good for character. It shows you what you are truly made of. Tests your mettle. Sends your soul through the crucible.\n\nTo be honest, it isn't the external inputs that most people should be fearful of. No, the most dangerous enemy any one person faces, the monster, the quiet, creeping, seething creature that is the true threat to your existence, at all times, is your own mind.\n\nI have been at war with myself ever since I entered \"civilization.\"\n\nAnd, let's face it, it sucks. It really does. People are idiots, the mob, senseless, writhing, never accounting for personal actions of the self, always criticizing the actions of others. There exists a mirror for a reason. That reflection should always be the loudest voice in your mind, pounding, reverberating, coursing through the cracks in the glass.\n\nFor most, this might be a good thing. Mine might actually succeed in killing me.\n\n(No, this message isn't concise and laid out clearly, which should speak volumes about the person who is writing this.)\n\nHere's a joke: what happens when you take a (probably) slightly psychopathic, introverted, not-clinically depressed kid, who has been sheltered by his parents his entire life, told that there is a certain way to think, home-schooled and kept out of the system, he will always be special, and that life must have an amazing plan for him?\n\nYou set his mind up to be hit by the biggest scorched earth policy since the United States dropped Agent Orange and napalm in Vietnam.\n\nEvery. Single. Element.\n\nFor most individuals, you go out into the world, you find friends, you find love, you communicate freely and you meet people and network, and there is absolutely no shred of effort in this. This isn't a bad thing. It's great! People should absolutely be able to do these things, and exercise their minds in these areas.\n\nMe... mine was different. Survived high school, and all the days that I would come home and wonder, \"what really dramatic and extra ways can I think of to make my death legendary?\" I'd make Shakespeare cry.\n\nFunny how most of the kids in my school thought I would be the next school shooter, even though the only thoughts of harm that ever came to me was either killing myself, or finding a way to burn the school down, with no one in it. I never intended to harm any of them. Strange... now that I think about it. Sure, many of them probably deserved to have their nails ripped out by pliers, but giving them something as extreme as death was never really an option... maim maybe, or slightly injure, scare.\n\nBut... according to the United States Department of Justice, none of these events ever happened.\n\nAll I really learned, because school itself was a fucking joke and I passed everything without even really studying (I wrote a 2,000 word essay in 15 minutes because it was the last day of turn in), was that I couldn't really trust people, I couldn't depend on hardly anyone for anything, and the only band of friends I had kept me around because of my math skills whenever they were dealing pills.\n\nI wish I could say things changed in college.\n\nThe depression, like a lurking nightmare in the darkness, didn't go away. It just found a more tactically advantageous position to terrorize me from.\n\nSame bullshit, different story. Roommate was a drug dealer, he was in with all the cool kids, always was able to find a woman whenever he wanted to, and I was the nerdy, pasty weirdo who was quiet all the time, had no self esteem, zero charisma, and was quickly finding out that the Department of Defense scholarship I got for my mechanical engineering degree was probably going to go to waste.\n\nThere is one positive about this. I got a front row seat to how effective proper networking is. I also discovered Mary Jane. Fun times... the only time I feel like I was able to have an actual conversation with the horror in my mind instead of just having to beat it back with a stick.\n\nOf course all \"good\" things must come to an end, and at the end of a second semester at the Polytechnic campus, I was a D student, and I was just sick of it all. The only difference between college and high school was that the teachers were more liberal, the kids were turning into adults, drugs were like candy, and I was incredulously behind on the social learning curve. Also, flunking out of college after telling yourself for the last five years that this was the path you had to take, kind of kits you in the humility and ego department.\n\nI began to just tell myself that I was stupid, worthless... a worm that crawled through the trenches of the earth, only to rise and be picked off by the infinitely more successful birds of the air.\n\nSo, that's a fairly indecent view of my mind, right?\n\nOh wait, there is so much more.\n\nAfter my crash and burn in college, I came back home, lived in my parent's basement, and found that all the motivation and inspiration that existed in my life was dead, completely. My mother, of course, saw this as an excellent opportunity to get some work out of her son, and got me to repair half the issues with the house we lived in at the time (365 S. Third St, Globe, Arizona, if I recall correctly).\n\nMet up with a few old \"friends\" from high school, the slightly deranged, always droopy, possibly anarchist and sleazebag types, and I found out we liked to smoke weed together too. Some good memories, some bad.\n\nIt was also during this time that I met the first love of my life, and quite possibly, the most dangerous one too. I won't say her name, but I will say that I tolerated more than a man should ever have to deal with, and controlled my anger and pain more times than I can count. It taught me valuable lessons on the importance of having lines that do not get crossed, and I learned that I was not quite as strong as I thought I was.\n\nI joined the Navy six months after meeting her, went to bootcamp, all the requisite schools, finally, the fleet, and deployment. 4 years had passed at this point, and without going into details, I found that she was unloyal to me, and she was the viper that pretended to be the dandelion, and I could no longer tolerate any more of her psychotic realities (cheating on me while I'm on leave to visit you and aborting my unborn child without telling me kind of does that to a man).\n\nAfter this point of breakup, I considered suicide, and for the, so far, first and only time in my life, I actually attempted it. This scene may have well been taken out of a Shakespearean play, because it was tragically comical. Put a gun to my head, pulled the trigger, round refused to fire. Primer cap was busted. Obviously, someone or something was looking out for me, because no coincidence is that coincidental.\n\nAs a sidenote: really I'm just so fucking done with extending my services out to people without any reciprocation in return. The amount of effort I put into others is astounding sometimes, involving money, emotional support, inspiration... but I never really receive anything in return, most of the time.\n\nBack to the topic...\n\nAfter the breakup with the now ex-fiance, I decided to try the dating world and I extended out beyond my typical reach to find, what I guess I could call, the one. Obviously, I haven't succeeded, but I think I've isolated the traits and emotional characteristics that cause problems for me.\n\nIt's both my fault and their fault. It's their fault for being psychotic, manipulative, spoiled rotten, and not used to thinking for others that they don't fully understand, as well as jumping to conclusions. It's my fault for being too nice and lenient, not setting boundaries, and not listening to the voices in my head when I'm being given obvious signs that the certain person I'm interested in, is in no way shape or form good for my own well being.\n\nIt sounds selfish and short-sighted, sure, but the most important person in the world is myself. This isn't intended to be a statement based on a fact that you can research, it's based on the relative perception of myself. Everyone should always be their own most important person.\n\nThe point of teamwork, and being in a relationship in general, at least from my perspective, is understanding that while you are the most important person to yourself, in the grand scheme of things, their successes and failures are also indeterminately linked to your own now.\n\nThat is how marriages and partnerships succeed.\n\nBoth parties have a goal and are willing to achieve that goal.\n\nKind of the statement of the human condition, to be honest. The human mind is almost entirely incentive driven. We seek a reward for our actions, whether it be through social acknowledgement, finances, or just general success in whatever we do in life.\n\nIsn't that the point of life?\n\nTo roll with the punchlines and strike out an existence that means something, not to other people, but to yourself?\n\nI would like to think that...\n\n(Dates don't really matter here, this article will continue to be updated with random threads on an indeterminate basis until my own existence cancels out, or I find what I'm looking for.)\n\nLet's talk about love now...\n\nI think Rick and Morty had a very solid point when relating to the article of \"love.\" Love is simply a chemical reaction in your brain, releasing increased levels of dopamine and other \"feel-good\" chemicals that tells your body that this person is worth your time (I'm sure my fellow chemists and physicians could probably explain that a bit better).\n\nLove is basically life's greatest trick.\n\nLife, or rather, your perception of life is the greatest illusion that your existence ever gave you.\n\nIn the grand scheme of the universe, an uncomfortable trend appears. In short, your life doesn't matter. Your existence does not determine the grand plan's course.\n\nYou could die right now, and the earth would continue spinning, the sun would continue shining (for another couple billion years, at least), and the universe as a whole would carry on with it's machinations as if you never existed in the first place.\n\nMaybe this explains the correlation that links intelligence and depression so close to each other... probably.\n\nAs the same applies to us, so to does it apply to possibly other civilizations out there. One of them could pass on, and it would not affect our daily lives in the slightest category.\n\nBut I digress...\n\nTo bring this all to a close before further updates present themselves, I am lost. I feel without hope.\n\nI don't have an incredible wife to support me.\n\nI don't have a family that would understand me.\n\nI don't have many friends that would make me feel any better about the finality of being born unto a world that attempts to destroy you until it finally succeeds in that dreary task.\n\nDoes this article make any sense? Probably not.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily even say that this is a suicide note. I'm always in an effort to treat life like the grand joke it is. What's the point of ending it early?\n\nI also understand that there are quite a few people out in the world who would be absolutely devastated if something ever happened to me, and I'm trying to be responsible and understand that.\n\nThis isn't the spontaneous kind of depression; this is the depression caused by heartbreak, rejection, humiliation, and hubris, piled higher and higher as the years have continued.\n\nThis is the slow knife, so to speak.\n\nWhile I'm not inherently at risk, at the moment, I do hope that others can see this and understand that this isn't an isolated incident. I'm writing this because I've finally reached the point where compartmentalization just won't cut it anymore.\n\nEDIT: With respect to the community and the people who may be reading this, I edited A LOT of information out that I had originally written up.",

            "selftext": "Ever since I was young things haven't been okay.  I was just too young to understand the severity. When I was 6 I was raped multiple times over the course of months by a close family member. I remember briefly telling my mom about it but she ignored it because she thought I was just \"pretending\". My parents would fight a lot, sometimes physical fights, and my siblings would sort of torment me. Despite this I still had a happy childhood, because I had a lot of friends and I was too naive to understand what was really happening. But as the years went by I started remembering what happened to me when I was 6 and realized that wasn't normal. The fear that something else would happen to me also grew since the family member that did it was still living with me. So at 11 I finally built up the courage to tell what happened to me and everyone except my dad has the least unsupportive reaction. Everyone in my family blamed me and thought I was lying until the person that did it finally admitted he did. Even after that they still had communication with him , and even my own mother dropped the charges that I WANTED to press against him. But after he admitted to doing it he no longer lived with me and he wasn't allowed around me anymore. When I was 12 I started noticing signs of depression but kept quiet about it because I had no one to go to, even if I wanted to get help. It worsened and when I was 14 my grandma died which honestly didn't really hurt me because I was never close to her. But at the funeral I saw him and he spoke to me and I think that really just made my already developing depression worse. A month after that my dad got in a motorcycle accident and almost died and that's when I noticed my anxiety got really bad. And within the same week my house got broken into. So my stress and anxiety was at an all time high. But things were looking up and I was excited about high school because I had gotten into early college. Things were grate for the first 3 months, but then I noticed my anxiety was really bad again, so bad to the point where I'd have to sit in the guidance counselors office to calm down and stop crying.  I just felt so alone and really started to reflect on my life and how shit everything had been, I was drifting apart from the friends I hade made too so I felt like I had no one to talk to. So I started missing days of school and that ended up in my parents calling my school and my guidance counselor told them about the anxiety and depression I was having and recommended for me to go to the hospital. So I went and spent my time in a mental hospital for the first time where I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and ptsd. This was the beginning of my downfall... now I just turned 16 like a week ago and honestly I don't know what my life has become. My parents are emotionally abusive towards me, my family is so dysfunctional and unsupportive , I have no friends, I'm dealing with heart break because every guy I've ever liked has hurt me, I stopped going to school a year ago, i have a hard time getting out of bed, I have literally nothing good in my life, or no one good in my life, I can't get the proper help for my mental disorders because my parents prevent it, I've been in a mental hospital 3 times now, and there's  so much more bs but I'm trying to cut this short. To sum up how supportive my parents are... my dad choked me while I was having a panic attack. I'm just so tired of my life and getting hurt. Suicide seems like the only option at this point, I've tried just about everything. I know I'm young and only 16 and I can still make a life for myself in the future but that seems so far away and kind of impossible rn. Humans are shitty anyways. Things get worse instead of getting better. So yeah, I just wanted to leave this here in case I do decide to kill myself. At least someone out there will know why I did it... (ty for reading if you made it this far)",

My life used to be wonderful but then something happened, it\u2019s to long of a story so I\u2019m just going to say that I lost everyone and everything I have ever love and held dear, through some miracle I got it back but I became a different person during these 4 months I lost everything, I never thought I would do drugs, smoke, fail a class, cut myself or try killing myself. I have drank bleach twice and both attempts failed. I fell in love with my previous best friend and we dated for about a month until she confronted me and told me she fell in love with the old happy me, so I guess if she can\u2019t love me at my low she doesn\u2019t deserve me at my high. She\u2019s still my best friend and I love her so god damn much but I don\u2019t think she even wants to be near me, we hung out and talked for hours then a few days ago she stopped talking to me, and started hanging out with random ass people and now she\u2019s always with them, and now I\u2019m all alone, I think I have lost the hand pulling me up from the ledge, I still have my \u201cbro\u201d but he\u2019s the ledge, I need a hand to, without both of them with me I have nothing, I am no one. I have other amazing friends but there not enough for me to hold on to. Now that I have lost half of who I am I have decided I live in hell until it gets better, or I commit suicide, and I dm t want any \u201chugs and love\u201d bull shit. I don\u2019t want someone to talk to, I don\u2019t want advice, I just want someone to listen to me, if I go through with this I will be forgotten without those people anyway so goodbye I guess...",

Alright, well I\u2019ve been depressed for awhile now but it\u2019s evolved into something worse. I basically have these mood swings where I feel really depressed hopeless and feel the only way out is death, then I get really happy and optimistic about life and feel I can do anything. Then I get really angry and hate myself and feel like killing and raping people. I take pleasure out of people\u2019s misery and death it gives me pleasure. Like reading about how somebody got killed or raped. I also self harm often. Sometimes cause I\u2019m depressed or others because it gives me pleasure. I also get really anxious over little things and feel everyone\u2019s gonna leave me. I\u2019ve got hardly any friends though. I know I\u2019m sick and need help but can somebody give me a serious professional answer on what might be wrong with me. I\u2019m consider going to get help soon. Thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "I've been on disability for ten years now, thanks to a diagnosis of  bi-polar disorder. \nFor awhile, it was great, a dream come true even. It allowed me to finish school, something I could not have done otherwise. \nHowever, since graduating five years ago I have not gotten a job. \nFacing the void of nothingness, being so incredibly poor, feeling like such a complete loser, failure, being outside the fabric of humanity (basically one step above homelessness, contributing nothing to society. Even fast food workers make some contribution to the web of life) ...I find it difficult to feel life is worth living.  \nMy friends most all have careers,  houses and families now.  I had never been one to compare myself with others, but now that the gap between me and them is SO large, it can't help but emphasize to me the misfortune of my current state. When we were all students, we were all poor, just getting by, but now they've become thriving adults while I have languished.\n\nAlthough I had relationships in the past, even lived with someone for 2 yrs another person 4 yrs, few if anyone is interested in getting with someone in their mid -30's, on disability and little prospect of getting off. So it's hard to feel any hopefulness there.\n\nI've tried looking for work, but with nothing to list for work experience and no references, it's a been difficult.  I get discouraged easily and have only had one interview. \n\nI spend a lot of time reading. This allows an escape into other worlds while requiring no physical activity.  \nI have hobbies (went to art school) but have an increasingly hard time indulging in them. I've always been somewhat low energy, but have become increasingly more so, where doing anything at all physical is daunting. I used to sometimes spend 12 hrs a day making art, now I haven't touched my tools in months.  At some points in my life, I had many friends. But since I tend to be fairly introverted and isolate myself when given the chance I no longer have many social interactions.  When you have no obligations, there is nothing to stop you from giving in to those tendencies. \n\nI feel if I had something like a job which made me get up and interact with people, it would help.  But I can't bring myself to get a shitty job and decent jobs seem to be out of reach. \nI'd like to volunteer somewhere, but my motivation to actually go through the steps to do it is so low.  I suspect it would help, but it's so much easier to just sit down with a book. \n\nThe more time passes, the less energy I have, the less I do, the less motivation I feel for anything, including life.\n\nI am on meds, which help enormously. I've been to therapy before, which helped and have considered getting a therapist again (fortunately healthcare is pretty good on disability) . \nBut without any sense of direction,  structure or community in my life, it's hard to find a reason to live. \nI have a few close friends, who live out of state. I've been open with them about my thoughts and they have been helpful and supportive. My family too. Sometimes I wish they wouldn't be, so I could feel more justified in taking my life.  They are the main reason I've stayed alive this far, because I know they will be hurt. Yet, it's hard to have my only motivation for life being not wanting to hurt those close to me. It's not much of a reason to wake up each day.\n\nSo I'm curious if other people here are in the same boat and how they carry on living, how to they find life worthwhile, while having nothing to do or look forward to? How do you find a sense of meaning or motivation? A sense of self. Or do you find being on government funds increases your desire toward suicide, as it does mine? ",

I don\u2019t think the happy moments make up for all the bad shit or months of emptiness. \n\nFor context I\u2019m basically a perfect student.

Weekends were slightly better I suppose. \n\nBut now, here I am. With a final AP presentation and 2000 word essay due in two days, both unfinished. Wishing I was dead and looking up how to get that wish. \n\nFor awhile, before therapy, the only thing that held me back from killing myself was fear or guilt of hurting my parents, my cat, friends, etc. But now I feel...detached from them. \n\nAnd I might just do it.

My family has always been poor, each parent (separated) making less than 30k a year. Me? I suffer dysthymia, chronic depression, that halves my energy and motivation in life, making it impossible to get out of bed sometimes. Worse, I also have General Anxiety Disorder, meaning I often get panic attacks. I've worked only one seasonal job in my whole life, and I panicked throughout it, fucking up transactions and speaking.    \n    \nMoreover, I don't drive. I *can't* drive. My anxiety is too extreme to - even as passenger in a friend's car, I still have some mild anxiety. I also can't take the bus because I am a woman and my neighborhood is actually pretty dangerous (gangs) and there have been cases of kidnappings around the area.    \n    \nFrom every angle I look at, I not only lack the skills to succeed in life, I also lack the possibilities to learn them due to my disorders. Therapy is working *very* slowly because I'm stilll dealing with a lot of trauma from my abusive childhood, and I've already graduated. I don't know how I'm going to *live*. Housing here is starting to skyrocket because of gentrification. My mom is nearing the age of retirement and expects me to take care of her too, and I don't think I can. I'm freaking out. I know people say baby steps, but I have been taking baby steps *forever*. My disorders are still pretty fucking bad.     \n     \n",

            "selftext": "I feel like SW is the next step up from the depression subreddit. I want to make it clear that yes I am feeling a certain way right now so I'm not making light or mocking anyone who uses either subreddit. I'm not doing very well right now, in fact I'm pretty scared for myself. I always come on here when I'm at the slope point and it helps me feel better momentarily but it doesn't take away the rest of the pain. I went to talk to someone on the hotline but the chat was cute up literally 57 deep in my area. It broke my heart to think about all those people sitting and waiting just to be heard, and how I feel just like they do. It can often feel like an echo chamber sometimes too.\n \n I saw a post that made me really mad. A guy took a picture of the bullet his father took his own life with and said please talk to someone anyone. But I have done that, I've reached out. I've tried to talk. I don't think people get it though unless they have been through it or empathize deeply because some people just make it worse when you talk. And you always feel afraid that if you talk you're going to be locked up, guess what I've been locked up several times because of this. On the psych unit they put you on an emergency hold for a few days and you can pretty much bullshit your way out of there if you wanted to. Either way it's meant to be a temporary stay unless you exhibit signs of harm towards yourself or others, at that point they decide if your insurance will pay for long-term treatment. I can say that I've had some pretty crappy experiences on the psych unit myself, and there are people who work there who should not be working in mental health ever. I do not want to discourage anyone from seeking out out because although I'm snarky about it right now I probably would not be alive if they didn't put me in cuffs and throw me in the psych unit.\n\nWhat I wish some people knew is that just talking isn't always going to fix the problem, and sometimes talking feels more dangerous than not saying anything. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from speaking up and I do think it's a good idea, but I have seen it Go badly. It seems like people just want to say go get help and that's all they say. That's all they do is give the same advice that people before them have said and they just regurgitate it without really thinking. When I feel this way I want someone to tell me that they care. I want a hug and to feel acknowledged some way. I want to go for a walk and get out of the house or go do something other than sitting around. I want a friend who will listen and not judge, and understand that this can happen to anyone really. We all have different needs but these are mine. The s word scares so many people that they almost shut down immediately. How can you speak to a brick wall?\n\nSo anyway I'm really not doing good and I only ate once today. It took a lot for me to even do that. Yes I am feeling suicidal and yes I have been having pretty vivid thoughts of it, mood swings and chaotic mind. When I am less slow I research Buddhism and self-help stuff. It's thought of that suicide is a state of perception that can change. It's temporary right? It's fleeting how could we let one thought dominate us to the point of ending it all? Right? I'm not so convinced it's always that simple. I'm tired of feeling weak though or thinking of myself as weak for not being able to just push these thoughts out like apparently other people can? \n\nI feel empty and dead right now inside. I Feel Complete hopelessness and I have no sense of my future or anything like that. The only reason I can articulate this is because I have been in therapy in the past. When I moved to the state that I am currently living in I lost health care and have been unable to afford another therapist. I've been without therapy for months now and I know it's making this all worse. I need some support",

I was gonna start therapy tomorrow too, and now I feel like I'm losing my mind.\n\nI always know when I'm starting to get genuinely close, see, it's never when I'm ranting about how much I wanna die. It's when I feel bad, worse than I ever normally feel, so bad that I don't rant, I can't think anymore because I feel so bad it physically hurts and my thoughts are racing too fast for me to pay attention to a singular one. That's how I just felt before I posted this, that physically painful sadness. I can't call an ambulance or some hotline, I won't let them put me in a hospital, and I'm not calling my parents, any other advice?",

But no suprise i was rejected, my anxiety makes it Impossible for me to find someone who will love me.

She lied to me and told me she's just seeing her friend, but I saw her phone over her shoulder when she was making plans for the date.\n\nShe was the only thing my life had going for it. Now I'm homeless and jobless, with no foreseeable future. I'm only 19, but that doesn't mean things will get better. I dont have the resources to make it better.\n\nI just want to die now. Nobody loves me, and the fact that this girl, who is the most loving and forgiving girl in the world, could stop loving me is proof of that. I don't have any reason to carry on, so why should I?\n\nI only have 3 reasons I haven't killed myself yet.\n\n1. I promised her that I won't.\n\n2. I'm afraid I'll go to hell if I do.\n\n3. I still get hopeful for us sometimes, but it's been proven several times that there really is no hope.\n\nI just want to die.\n\nI even know some ways I could do it either quickly or painlessly. I own a shotgun, or I could buy some helium and use a plastic bag to suffocate myself without feeling it.\n\nIs there really any reason I shouldn't?",

            "selftext": "I am a 15 y/o male who lives in the uk. I have been depressed for a year and a few months now due to my mothers alcohol addiction which she had since I was 9/10y/o. She has stopped drinking after almost dying when she slit her wrists in a drunken state earlyer this year but I assume she will start again within a year. My family sees me as some sort of weirdo for being, and I dont mean to brag and sorry if it comes of this way, very good at maths and science, unfortunately I am retarded and cant england for the life of me. My dad is kinda nice sometimes but most of the time he is annoying. My younger brother is a huge cunt who always takes the piss out of me for nothing. My older brother lives in nottingham with his gf as the rest of my family, including me oc (oc means of course not oc in this context), moved to fucking cumbria where it smells like cow shit and it has awful wifi. My older brother is my favourite relative, which sucks balls cause I see him around 3 times a year. I usually play csgo and pubg with my 2 friends that I met online but I cant atm cause the wifi is limited to 100gb untill june (when my parents house is made). I have a third friend I made on reddit that I talk to everyday. Everyone at school hates me and I would say that some even bully me which is annoying.\n\nThere are 4 reasons which are holding me back: my older brother, my mate from reddit and my 2 gaming friends. My reddit friend who I shall call x (oc not her real name) is the main reason I dont want to do it as she is also suicidal and she has told me a few times that if I where to end up killing myself then she would too. I dont want to be the cause of her death but I also want to die so I may just sort of stop talking to her so that she may not even realise. Is that wrong of me to do that? Anyway the point of this post is to rant and hopefully if someone has some magical solution to end all my problems that would be perfect, cheers.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Fair warning, this is gonna be a rant.\n\nI suck at life. At least I feel like I do. I'm socially incompetent, afraid of commitment, lazy, lacking motivation... I have my qualities of course but I can hardly find any value in them. I can say I'm really suicidal per se, but pretty much every aspect of my life makes me wanna give up completely, and I'm definitely not afraid of death.\n\nI'm 18, and ever since my best friend ditched me when I was 11, I've only had one close friend, and we've lived in different cities ever since so I only get to see him like once every 6 months. Not only do I lack close friends, I'm also terrible at having normal friends and somehow I'm only comfortable around other awkward people, which leads to my friendships being very passive. The best I can do with the others is be on good terms, and I'm pretty much on good terms with everyone I know. Sometimes I hate even that, I wish I had the strength to get angry at people, or have enough self esteem to think badly of others, but no, instead I just get along with everyone, being a completely forgettable person.\n\nIn my studies, I'm not doing terrible but I've never had the grades I'm capable of having. I'm quite smart (one of the qualities I don't value much), or at least I'm good at taking exams and understanding subjects. I deeply lack discipline, motivation and concentration, which obviously makes me very frustrated with myself. Yet again, because of my weak character, I'm not upset enough to do something about it. Even personal projects that I do for fun, I give up on. And I don't give up halfway through, I give up barely after having started. I'm almost certain I have ADHD, but the tests I took were inconclusive, so the doctor told me to stop taking the pills, even though they were helping me considerably.\n\nI've been like this pretty much since I was 11, except I've matured which made me more aware of my own limitations, and I've also grown older, which means I'm losing little by little the comfort of \"still having a lot of time\". More than half of the people my age have lost their virginity, yet I haven't had a single relationship, nor have I come close. What I want is someone close, someone to give me affection and attention, someone to understand me, someone to choose me, see some sort of value in me, but it just feels like I'm being delusional. I received a note on Valentine's day, which made me very happy, even though I was almost certain it was a prank, because that meant one of my friends thinks about me enough to pull a prank on me, but it's been 2 months and in the long run the hope of it being from a girl is killing me.\n\nI do nothing. My life consists of sudden and rare moments of motivation and hope, followed by long and regular periods of laziness and instant-gratification, with somewhat frequent (biweekly or so) moments of sadness and realization (quite like tonight). I just don't see it getting better. At this point I'm praying someone else gets involved with me and makes me a better man, because I sure as hell can't do it on my own.\n\nWhen it comes to relationships I don't know where to start. I'm not really drawn to casual sex, but at this point it might be my only shot at getting better with women, even though what I'm really looking for is something more serious and more significant, to give me a reason to care about life.",

I suppose my mental health is a factor to blame, I constantly question whether I'm sound of mind or not, having a brain bleed and a shunt put in at birth lead me to wondering what is normal what should be normal, at the beginning of this year I got into a big screaming match argument with my mother, we were both hateful towards each other and she said fuck you I would've kicked you out if your father didn't think you were special in the head, I don't think she meant it or maybe she did. As far as I know we both decided to pretend that wasn't said and move on, I doubt she remembers screaming it to my face as we tend to get into a lot of arguments over silly shit but it's forever etched into my brain and I've considered suicide for some time now long before that, but that drove the nail down and a day hasn't gone by where I haven't thought about killing myself it's more than that though, there's the other shit too, depression, addiction, and college junk.  I doubt a counselor or psychologist will help. I dunno....I've got a plan to end it soon, I'm highly allergic to ibuprofen so it will do the trick.",

            "selftext": "I'm thinking about suicide multiple times a week now, it's getting quite serious. I live in a high building thus easy access. I am very afraid for what comes next but sometimes my mind is so black and foggy that i can't think straight. My problems in a row:\n* I am 31 years old, master degree in law but it took me 9 years to finish, i now have a shitty temperary dead end job outside my field. I see no future.\n* Ive avoidant personality disorder, i am socially very akward (not imaginitive, really true). My job involves social talks a lot and the stress about that is too much.\n* health problems, ive diabetes, i am obese, i experience hair loss.\n* i feel so so so awful in my own body , i hate it so deeply that i want my soul to be free from it. Every second of the day i am aware of the very thin hair i have, and of all the fat. I Always feel dirty and uncomfortable. I dont know what to wear anymore, every day is a challenge to arrive at work, going in the bus, then walking.. then surviving the horror at work. Then repeat.\n* i am very lonely , have no friends, only my parents and sister. My mother has cancer for 1 year now. Treatment is working well, but every scan is nervewrecking and i am afraid luck will end one day and she will be gone. This problem i just supress a lot but its there..\n* summer is coming, will be so warm and more uncomfortable with my body .. most of the warm days i feel i cant think, i panic and feel like im in a prison and need to escape.. very scared for these days.\n\nToo much stress. Too much worries. Never happy moments. Always feeling uncomfortable, that last one is the worse, strangely enough. I just feel like i do not belong in this body. I hate it so much and i dont want it to be with me. I am trying to lose weight now but i doubt if i ever will feel okay.. if the weight is gone, it will be the loose skin.. and the hair willl still fall out probably. I see no solution.\n",

            "selftext": "I need a place to vent so bear with me. \nI've lived a mediocre life; not the best family situation but also not the worst. My father is an alcoholic, every time he drinks he verbally abuses me and my mum. He drinks every day. My mother has such a good heart, but her social and personal background has made her value her self-esteem based on the men in her life and not able to be independent. She stuck with my father no matter the cheating, the abuse and the alcoholism and I think I always kinda resented her for that.\nDuring school, I was pretty smart academically speaking, but had no real interests. Was doing it just to please my parents and because everyone said it was the right thing to do. Once out of high school fell into a deep depression and started suffering of panic attacks and severe anxiety. Started studying computer science because everyone thought it was the right choice for me, based on the time I spent in front of my computer. Lost all interest and now I'm not even going to classes, just wasting time. I've been in a few relationships: two major ones. One I've become overly attached to the other person and he fell out of love with me. I am in one currently but he doesn't understand my thoughts and my troubles. He doesn't quite understands what hurts me and what not. Since I am quite insecure there are a lot of things that hurt me so I'm pushing him away as well because I don't think it's fair for him to deal with my stuff. I actually broke up with him today, I was so hurt by one stupid action and he couldn't understand my point of view so I just ended it. Thought it was better that way. Now it hurts as hell but it's better for me to deal with it than for him.\nThe only thing that kept me alive for the last 5 years are my dogs. They are the only reason why I don't end it today. \nI don't have nothing else to wake up for, I don't see a brighter future, I don't want to keep living. I dread the day I end up in an unhappy and abusive marriage like my mother. This is what I fear most. \nAll my life I dreamed and hoped for what I most missed, a happy life and a lovely family of my own. Seems impossible to achieve now.\nI am currently on medication and in therapy but I can't say it's being useful.\nDon't know what else to do, don't know how to wake up with a purpose or how to get a full night of sleep. \nMight be the wrong place but I need help.",

My only friends are on the internet but since my dad came home from prison for probation we can't have internet. I used my neighbor's house for it, and she was like a role model to me. Now she's leaving and even worse lied to me about it. I can't afford apartments in this area. I finally found a good job. I've been working two, along with going to school. My mom still complains about money. I keep sleeping later and later. Woke up at 5 PM yesterday and freaked out. Spent 50 dollars just for them to tell me to go to bed earlier. America. My dreams are all sad and disturbing. There's no escape there. My parents talk about me behind my back, like I'm some needy, lazy little bitch because I wanted to feed the ducks so I could talk about things or because I slept till dusk then disappeared.

I have no motivation or direction and cant see myself being able to live on my own or be happy. I sleep most of the day and i now have a eating disorder. Things seem to never get better and i think of killing myself everyday and want to do it but i am to scared. My life is meaningless and people would be better off without me.

            "selftext": "This post isn\u2019t for me. The numbers I\u2019ve found started because I was looking for some type of prevention but I\u2019ve moved past that, and now I need to address the bigger issue. \n\nAround 20,000 people visit the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline online chat per month. There are around 85,600 subscribers to the SuicideWatch subreddit.  There are thousands (if not more) of suicide prevention websites, lifelines, and all of the above. And these are only for people who have the resources, courage, and knowledge to look online. \n\nThere are also so many people who consider suicide who either don\u2019t think of looking online or don\u2019t have the resources to look for some type of online prevention. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m giving you these numbers is because all of this is too much to be \u201clife isn\u2019t perfect\u201d.  It\u2019s more than \u201cyou don\u2019t always get your way\u201d. \n\nYou may interpret them differently, but these numbers tell me that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way we build our society, and it needs to change.  20,000 people visiting a chat lifeline is 20,000 too many, and we can\u2019t continue to normalize this. We can\u2019t keep giving suicide prevention without looking at what\u2019s driving so many people to need all of this suicide prevention. We need change.  \n\nNow I don\u2019t have all the answers; for that matter, I don\u2019t have any. But I know that we need to figure out how to stop this. We can\u2019t just keep everything as is and ignore these numbers, we have to do something about it, even if it means completely tear down the base that our society is built on and start fresh, if that helps. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t have the answers. None of us do. But if we put our heads together, we may be able to start a movement- a revolution that completely changes the fundamentals of our society- that brings these numbers down. \n\nThis is where I reach out to all of you. If you have any ideas of how this could be improved, speak up. I don\u2019t care even if my inbox is flooded tomorrow with people saying we should try out communism because any idea is a step in the right direction, because one suicide, even one person thinking about it, is one too many. \n\nMy other message is that, if you are suicidal, you aren\u2019t alone. Look at these numbers and realize that more than 85,000 people are going through the same thing that you are, and I\u2019m sure most of them are more than willing to talk. \n\nLastly, I am suicidal. Well, this helped me work through things, but I was. I\u2019m just telling you this because it\u2019s important for you to know that this is coming from someone who is going through the same things as you. \n\nI know this was long, but thanks to anyone who read through the whole thing and I hope that together we get start the movement that\u2019ll move our society away from suicide. \n",

            "selftext": "I've been struggling recently with thoughts of suicide and needed to vent somewhere.  I really don't want to kill myself, but I'm getting to the point where I feel like that's the only logical decision.  All I want is to be happy but it seems like no matter what I do nothing can change.  Every day I wake up and dread having to make it through another day.  I feel incredibly alone and I'm surrounded by people that have loads of friends which just makes me feel that much worse about myself in comparison.\n\nObjectively, I know that what I'm feeling really doesn't make sense.  I'm about to graduate college, I'm healthy and in good shape, and I have a great job lined up for after graduation.  I always try to be nice to others, whether that's through doing stuff for them, being a shoulder to cry on and just helping people out in general.  People always tell me that I'm such a great person but that's as far as it ever goes.  People don't want to hang out or talk with me, any attempts I make to enter conversations get shut down more often than not, and whenever I do get invited to do stuff or hang out I feel like I'm just getting invited because people feel bad for me.  I feel so alone and can't figure out what I need to change about myself to fix things, I've asked people and the only answer I ever get is people pretending the problem doesn't exist.\n\nI feel like I've done everything I can and I'm starting to lose hope.  I've talked about my issues and how I feel with people that I think are my friends, but I've more or less been completely ignored, even though they asked me to tell them what was wrong.  I feel like I have to fake being happy everyday because if I'm quiet or sad, people want to hang out with me even less.  I go the gym everyday, eat healthy and try to stay as active as possible but all those things do is give me a temporary break from how I feel, and inevitably things keep flooding back.  \n\nI've always told myself that things will get better.  I went to 3 different high schools growing up and every time I went to a new one I told myself that this would be the time things finally change for me.  The same thing happened each year of college, I was convinced that living somewhere new, or with someone else would change things but it never did.  Now I'm approaching the end of my senior year and can't get myself to believe that anything's going to change when I move on.  I feel like I'm just lying to myself whenever I hope that things will get better.  If the \"Best 4 years of my life\" have been this awful then I just don't see any reason at all to keep on living.  People say things will get better but I just can't believe it anymore.",

I know I could pull a trigger.\n\nFrom what I've read I'm likely to regret it on the way down, but that's OK. 5 seconds of regret is better than waking up every day being disappointed that I'm still alive.\n\nThe worst part is when I walk home after going to the cliff. All I've done is failed again. Soon I'll manage it, I'm getting so close now. I'm going to go every day this week. I only need to succeed once.\n\nWhy am I writing this? Maybe I just want attention. That's probably true. I'm reading this back and it's just the rambling of an insane person. I guess that's also true.\n\nI guess I just want to 'speak' honestly. I haven't had a real conversation with someone for months now. Every time I talk to somebody at work, which is the only time I ever speak to other people, half of my thoughts are just me screaming at myself 'WHY AM I STILL ALIVE? YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD INSIDE, JUST DO IT YOU PIECE OF SHIT'.\n\nThanks for reading. It feels good. I really think killing myself will both be the most difficult thing I've ever done and my greatest achievement.",

            "selftext": "I'm worried about my recent ex-boyfriend and current roommate. Just last night as I was falling asleep I made a connection between two things he had told me, one that earlier that day and the other a few days ago. \n\nA few days ago I was dropping him off at a friend's place and as we were on our way he mentioned that he's been reading up on Catholicism, about the history, bibles stories, and just the \"lore\" in general (forgive me I'm not religious myself and I'm not sure what the proper term is). This isn't totally out of the ordinary since he went to catholic school until sixth grade and has said before that he's always found all of the background very interesting. Then yesterday while we were sitting around before going to bed he said something along the lines of \"you now have access to my google docs account, and there's something in there for you if something happens to me\". I know this in itself kind of looks like a red flag but he has had a long history of grief throughout his life, starting in his early childhood. Many people he's loved have passed away and he's just very aware of the fact that anyone can die at any time without warning. Because of this I immediately just assumed it really was something he had said/done \"just in case\". Then as I was falling asleep I noticed he was reading about Catholicism again, and I also realized that I think I may have seen him typing out something very long into his phone the past few nights (I'm not one to pry so I didn't ask what it was but I now suspect that it was whatever he mentioned was in his google docs). Then two suddenly clicked together in my head. I don't think it's uncommon for people to become suddenly very interested in religion before taking their own lives. This coupled with this potential note is concerning.\n\nWe broke up about mid-February, I won't go into the details but it's been very hard on him, as it would be for anyone. We were best friends before we began dating and that dynamic returned very quickly after breaking up, as both of us still love each other deeply and want to continue to be in each other's lives. We are getting along perfectly well, and he has a good group of friends that he sees often and has been spending a lot of time with recently. There is nothing else in his behavior to suggest he may be feeling suicidal, although I may have missed something, it is exam season so there's a lot going on. But other than that he seems like his total normal self. I asked him this morning if everything was alright and if he was feeling ok. He seemed confused by my asking so I'm not sure if I'm overthinking this. \n\nI'm leaving for the summer, back to my hometown, and I will be gone for four months until the next term begins again. In just over a week I will be gone, and I am extra worried because I've just now noticed this and won't be here soon. He'll be all by himself in our little apartment. We have some great neighbors that we're close with, I've thought about asking them to keep a close eye on him while I'm gone. \n\nIt might also be worth noting that he has his fair share of a heavy load in life. He's got a lot to deal with every day, and compared to our average person he's been dealt a very shitty hand. He's said more than once that if I ever died, he would just kill himself because he couldn't handle losing another person he loves (I'll clarify that this was NEVER said in an abusive/manipulative fashion at all but merely like he was stating a fact). \n\nHe is truly my best friend and I just want him to be safe, happy, and healthy. I am looking for a second opinion, and some advice of how to potentially bring it up with him/what to do in general. I don't want to upset him or make him worry that I am worried about him, especially as I am leaving so soon. \n\nThank you so much everyone. ",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone. \nI am a suicide survivor. I have overdosed on sleeping pills three times. The last time, my heart rate went down to almost nothing and I got real close. When they told me that at the hospital, I couldn't tell if I was disappointed or relieved. Since then, I am under constant supervision, all my medication is always locked and I only have access to enough for a couple days. If I want something, I ask my husband for it. I am so grateful for having him and having him be such a big support. Sometimes, things still get pretty heavy... last week I was having a really hard time. I wanted my pills so badly and have I had access to them, I would probably have died. I always said I am not capable of causing myself any physical pain. Like cutting or jumping in front of a train/traffic. I also don't like thinking about the mess I would leave for people to clean up. But last week I was so desperate, I went out and bought razor blades. I didn't use them, but today I got really close. My husband is gone for the weekend and gets back tonight. I took the blades and put them in the trash chute because I know I don't want to do this. But sometimes, there is this impulse and really strong will to die, and since buying those blades I am scared for myself, and I have a hard time asking for help. \nI grew up with a mother that threaten to kill herself all the time, and in my head, asking for help is almost like asking for attention (which technically I know it's not true, but in my guts that is not my feeling).

            "selftext": "I considered submitting an Op-Ed to the New York Times about this. I think I know what the problem is and why it happens in America more than anywhere else.\n\nThis morning I became enraged over an interaction on my other reddit account, the one that I use for work. I needed to build up karma on it in order to communicate with people for research purposes later on this summer, and so I decided to get involved in sub related to my field of study and just post short encouraging comments to people and help keep conversations going.\n\nWho knew that even random short kind comments will earn me trolling and vitriol? A guy made fun of the way I wrote my comment, a feature of which was merely a rhetorical choice rather than anything related to the substance of the discussion. He called me annoying and mocked me and I think he delighted in hurting my feelings. Such is the way on the internet.\n\nI am frequently suicidal. It's gotten worse as I've gotten older. And I am a woman, and you know what a sin it is for women to pass the age of 35. The truth is that when we gain weight and lose our youthful face shape we become invisible. Nobody cares what we have to say anymore because the only reason they ever did in the first place was because we were young and nice to look at. We never were complex human beings from the start. That alone is enough to make me want to either kill myself or everyone else.\n\nThe way that commenter mocked me just snowballed in my brain. If he had been in front of me, I would have shot him in the face with no remorse. it scared me that it made me so angry. And that's NOT me. I am an extremely emotionally sensitive person, I don't even like guns, and I am always trying to consider the humanity even of people who I disagree with.\n\nWhen I was a kid I was bullied for being like this. It makes me think that most people on Earth, even those in modernized societies, still think we are in the jungle and that displays of strength and sexual prowess are the only things that are important. They tell me I think too much, that I'm a loser intellectual whose \"side will never win\" because we spend too much time with our noses in books and we are weak. But I don't think in sides. I just want solutions to problems that are based on objective knowledge. I don't really care about tribes, political parties, or religious beliefs or brute force. I'd rather think things through, which I guess is part of the problem.\n\nBut I feel invisible. I feel like I did as a 13 year old getting pushed around and excluded from things because I was a thinker. I came off as \"weird\" to people and only now in adulthood have I realized that it was because I had such a strong internal dialogue going that was evident on my face. People didn't really know how to describe it but they knew I was different.\n\nWhen I was young I talked myself out of suicide on a weekly basis by saying that even though I was weird now, it would all pay off someday because I'd grow up to contribute something important to the world and all my haters would be wrong.\n\nThat's not really how it turned out. And in this country in particular, we produce a few superstars at the expense of everyone else. Many people in our country don't feel like their life has meaning unless they are well known. This is a natural side effect, I think, of an individualized, capitalist society where it's all about survival of the fittest (or the richest, healthiest, and most attractive.) People who are over the top intelligent usually can overcome not being attractive or rich or even healthy, but even the B+/A- types aren't smart enough to overcome what people respond to the most - sex and violence. I'm not necessarily against capitalism but this is something that happens as a result of it.\n\nSo these mass shooters choose violence. I suppose if there were more opportunities for people to feel like they mattered, or if we just didn't raise kids with the idea that they needed to \"grow up to be important\" in the first place, we would have fewer of these extreme incidents. \n\n(Of course there should also be discussions about what the data says about gun control, mental health resources, and all the other things people fight about but that's not what I'm writing about here so lets not have that discussion, please.)\n\nThis is about what happens on an emotional level and I don't know - I could see myself someday getting angry enough to do something crazy and I'm glad I figured this out because now I can get myself some help. I still want to die every day of my life, and I know that if I did it, while the people who knew me would feel sad, strangers would just make fun of me - they'd call me weak, crazy, or a coward, because that's what animals do. It's hopeless.",

I can't do anything simple like watching something or playing a game because my mind can't focus long enough and I'm so fucking scared\n\nThis culminated in an anxiety attack so bad that I thought I was having a heart attack with perfectly matching physical symptoms, I had to go to the ER only to be told I'm in great condition and waste $5000\n\nI don't have anyone really I can talk to about this I'm sure my friends are fucking tired of hearing about it and I don't have a significant other anymore\n\nPlease help me",

I grew up without love from my father and was socially fucked up by elementary school. I grew up as a complete social pariah, and in middle school I realized the reason nobody liked me was because I was a disgusting, bratty little shit. Around this time, my dad was severely depressed and took it out on me emotionally. He also convinced everyone around me that I was a complete tantrum-throwing monster. I didn't learn how socialization worked without getting completely cut out until I was 19. Now it's two years later and I'm still in a deep hole. But now I regularly and uncontrollably verbally and physically abuse myself. I feel incredibly alone. I understand I'm not likable, or a person that people want to be around. But I just want to feel like I'm worth something to someone. I have a habit of reading into things people say too deeply and obsessing over people I get crushes on, but it always ends in tragedy from my own mistakes, misreading or doing. I'm a creepy fuck who can't even operate on a level to reach a romantic point with someone. My brain is inherently broken.\n\nI'm so tired of the constant pain in my chest. I'm tired of the constant invasion of images of me dying, being executed or meeting horrible tragedy. I'm tired of resisting that burning tension in my mind to attack my head, I'm tired of collapsing at home and having no will to move and losing myself in my head at work and being a useless weight. I hate myself more than anything and I can't stop, I need this pain to end. I don't know what to do.",

I try to reach out to people and help them, but I've realized it's all for my own selfish reasons anyways.\n\nAll I wanted so badly was for someone to mirror me, to do for me as I'd done for them. It's not fair for me to expect that of people, so I can't be angered. I do feel trivialized, however, and less important than I've ever felt.\n\nI wish I could explain the extent of my feelings and be taken seriously. Yet my pride is much too big to force someone to listen to me, to force them to make time in their day for my bullshit. \n\nSo all this time I've been asking about others' lives, listening about their stressful work day, how they wish they had a girlfriend, how their mom drives them up the wall... Meanwhile I've been planning my death. Researching, toying around with different methods, arranging a plan that is both foolproof and simultaneously spares my loved ones trauma of finding my brains splattered across the walls. \n\nI've been writing and re-writing my note, will, final thoughts and explanations. Been trying to come up with answers that my family might have had for me.  I need for things to be meticulous. I can feel the last threads inside of me snapping, and I need to have everything prepared for when I do. I don't know when I'll get the adrenaline rush to make this decision without thinking of the failure that might accompany it; I feel it's only a matter of time that I take the risk of failure. It's the only thing holding me back. Who wants to attempt suicide only to end up a fucking human vegetable? \n\n\nSorry for the length, sorry for wasting your time reading this, sorry for sounding melodramatic. Just needed somewhere to unload what's been silently racing in my head. \n",

            "selftext": "I don't even know where to begin. I'm a 30 year old psychologist, with training and a lot of experience in therapy and helping others, and I want to die. I'm sick of always being there for other people and them never being there in return; I'm sick of having jobs where I do good work but end up burnt out because of the crappy way the NHS works and the shitty management and bitchy colleagues that this field seems to attract; I'm sick of not having a job right now, I did a masters and got the highest grade and have so much experience but still can't get a job I would like to do; I'm sick of feeling like everyone else is moving on with their lives and getting what they want out of life and then here I am, hating myself and feeling worthless and that my worth is only based on how much I can do for other people rather than anything else. I'm sick of bad relationships, feeling like this is karma for leaving an unhappy relationship before, feeling like everyone just goes away eventually - is it me? Am I so terrible? I like to think that i am a really kind and thoughtful and considerate person, and actually I am, and I am REALLY good at my job and psychology and research and everything but where has this got me? No where. \n\nThe only reason I exist is to keep my parents happy, because I know they would be devastated if I killed myself, and because I want them to be ok and they really need someone to look after them because everyone has flown the nest and I am the only one who seems to care enough about them to do things with them still, and I can just see that when I'm older my life is going to be caring for my parents when none of my siblings will help and they are elderly and ill.\n\nBut now I'm seriously thinking that they will be ok, and if I am not around then maybe someone else will step up. And so I've decided that if I can make my death look like an accident, that will be easier on my parents because they know I am clumsy and accident prone. So it's what I want to do. \n\nI don't even know why I'm writing here. I suppose the whole of my life I have just really wanted someone to talk to, who's not going to go away. I have a boyfriend, but he is on holiday with his family and his crazy controlling mum doesn't know about me because she thinks he doesn't need a girlfriend and shouldn't have one, so he had to go to sleep because she controls everything about him still (he's only a couple of years younger than me) and he needs his 8 hours sleep or I don't know, the world will end or something according to her. So i'm really upset, and he had to leave and go to sleep (8 hours ahead timezone at the moment). I am actually going to therapy recently too, and my therapist is lovely, but i feel like she is overwhelmed with all the new stuff I keep bringing every session. There's a lot of it. And I've been to therapy a few times before, and it's helped to a certain extent, in that I understand why certain people have done certain things adn the why some things are as they are, but it hasn't changed how i feel, that I am just alive for my parents sake.\n\nSo yeah. Sorry this is so rambling and crap and whiney. But I'm tired of trying all the time and the thought of just dying is increasingly irresistible. \n\nEdit: wow so bad formatting. ",

            "selftext": "I've been wanting to post here for a month but couldn't find the \"whateverisneeded\" to do so, I really hope to rant and have my tantrum properly lol... \n\nEvery day I feel like I'm free falling from the sky. It's an accurate description because there's **nothing** to rely on and that's the thing that has been hunting me the most. \n\nI've started to realize more the extent to how much my childhood has affected me and how messed up I am today, it's a door that I low-key wish never was opened, there're things I wish they were back then and things I wish were happening now, sadly I don't think I have the power to make anything change...\n\nI'd love everything to be completely normal for a day and not to wonder how is it like loving your dad so so much, the way it feels hugging him during the cold nights, how is it like being put to bed, protected and taken care of... I bet it's warm :). Instead of that I got sexually harassed by my own mom, sexually abused by a fucking crazy dude, humiliated, insulted, abandoned, neglected and so on. \n\nI don't think there's a lot of people out there who can say that they were left in an apartment during a whole week alone and locked with no television, computer or games, just a huge amount of chocolate donuts and a radio with 3 stations, and repeat this situation almost every single day during years.\n\nI'm not sure if there is someone who woke up because their mother was jerking them off.\n\nHas any of you ever been told by your \"male parent\" (the times you were with him) that he liked to be with you because you are very stupid and thanks to that he can force you to open your fucking mouth and eat the shit he defecates out of his ass while you remain shut up during and after the process with a devil smile and glare? anyone?\n\nI wonder how different would I be today if I was a bit selfish and had denounced it and stop that hell, I was just a 5 years old kiddo tho when it all started to be something really serious, I thought that was normal tho, maybe I wouldn't have this beyond deep depression, the panic- level anxiety, maybe I wouldn't be pursuing the \"perfect body\" **so obsessively** thinking that it will land me in a perfect life yet only thing I have is a shitty self-esteem that I can't even look in the mirror and that I look worse every day because of the stress my mind has me under and as result I don't eat, I don't go out, I don't have the energy to hang out with friends, have social anxiety.\n\nI have an infinitely hard time to reciprocate feelings, I don't think I ever have, it scares me and makes me feel uncomfortable for some reason, I don't like any kind of \"commitment\" (except dad-son) and I could freak out and never speak a word to said person again at any moment if I feel \"disgusted\" by the affection we have. It's a curse because even tho I probably want that affection a part of me avoids it lol. \n\nI've been always so strong but I don't wanna be anymore, I wanna rest during one day of it, be weak, such a pussy and have a nice dad to hug me soooo tight and feel loved and cuddle and love him and prepare dinner for him, too. Just tell me Reddit, how do I live this way? if no matter how hard I try; my hunger for love, attention, and security from a dad may **never** be met. I couldn't think of one right now. It's taking too many tools on me, I don't know what do I continue for, in fact, I am not sure I want to... not this way, it's pointless tbh.\n\nIt's saaaad, it's blueeeee, I'M blueeee, in spite of everything that has happened, I'd be so happy if I had a dad, I'd be motivated, I'd feel loved, I could love him.  Why the hell do I have \"to be so strong\", I mean, excuse me, when did I say I wanted to? when did I say I wanted to be mature and have a lot of ~~bad~~ experience~~s~~ thanks to having gone through it, is this for real? I don't remember signing up at any school to be tested through living in hell and not having anyone, this should be a prank and it can definitely end right now lol. \n\nGeez, this took me 6 hours, it was hard. I've omitted too much stuff, I've probably used a shitty grammar and what not but this is the way I ended up doing it. \n\nI'd be glad to hear your stories as well and just in case, if there's someone who wants to get me out of my misery and be the dad I need just let me know... I pay back, I promise lol.\n\nBye.",

She hears voices and sees ghosts at night.\n\nShe's been through a huge trauma that she relives aswel.\n\nI really do love her but after 7 months she still hasnt really improved while my life is on hold for her. I have to make work of my future.\n\nBut the institutions are so strickt that i feel really lonely most of the time. Unhappy more then the other way around. Living in fear and doubt. I actually feel chained to extreme misery. \n\nAlso she has huge issues with a physical relationship. Which is something i really crave. Ive been waiting for 7 months already. I really need this, i really sound like a dick here. \n\nIve done everything for her. All i could. More even. But my meds got trippeled in dosage during our relationship and i began drinking again. Ex alcoholic here.\n\nThere is nothing more i can do for her but im exhausted and going deeper and deeper myself. Getting suicidal thoughts myself again.\n\nIts a 1way train in our ship. I cant keep this up anymore... Any tips?\n\nMost people close to me think i should break up. For my own good. That i deserve easier and better... \n\nThx for letting me share...",

Awareness of the suffering going on everywhere around you. Your own suffering. Suffering that you inflict on others, intentional or otherwise. I think the thing that makes me most dissatisfied in all of existence is the human lie, the pursuit of happiness. It's just that, a pursuit, and one which can never be seized upon for those who have pried their eyes to the immense misery in this world. I've tried being happy, angry, crazy, sad, and a plethora of various other moods and states of being. I just simply don't have an aptitude for emotional processing. So I've decided that from today on I'll feel nothing at all, and if the weight of that decision should become to much to bear I will treat myself punitively and snuff myself out like the insignificant insects that we all are.

We can't call the emergency number like 911 to ask for help about suicide. The police will say that you're stupid. People don't attend a funeral of someone who committed suicide because they believe that people who take their own life is worthless and stupid. We don't have psych ward in here except you live in the capital city or you are rich enough to pay for the medical expense in private hospital. I went to the US once and I realized that even though your country has many problems about health care system, but you guys are still lucky that most people there don't judge people who have mental illness. You can go to the emergency room and tell the doctor that you're thinking about suicide. Then they might admit you and take care of you. For me I live in the place called \"Third World\". I can't even tell anyone here that I'm suicidal. I can't go to the hospital for therapy. All I can do is just being here on Reddit and read supportive comments from strangers. I'm so jealous of the US citizens. Most people there are so well educated about mental health issues. I wish I lived there ): I'm dreaming of being the old me, having a good life. I need myself back but every time I fight against depression I always lose. I'm here to tell you guys who have a chance to reach mental treatment that you are so lucky! Sooooo lucky!!

And having good job prospects. to being mugged, cheated on, dumped, falsely arrested (by my ex partner, charges were dropped), lost all my friends.\n\nNow I'm living in my home town working 40+ hours a week on minimum wage just to save up enough to do something with my life. No one wants to hire me for anything but working in a shop. I cant go back to university without paying for it myself.  And every single night i just go home and spend time by myself. Every day for 2 years. Ive tried meeting people. Tried finding someone to love. Ive applied for 100 or so apprenticeships and other jobs/courses. And exausted every option i can think of to get my life back on track. \n\nIn all honesty im just tired. I havent seen any friends or been happy even one moment in the last 2 years.\n\nIm lost. I dont know what to do anymore and the only reason i havent attempted again is because it would make my mum sad. I really want to die. Im so tired",

            "selftext": "Not everyone's cut out for life and I've come to terms with that. Just a constant struggle, trying to change things when I know full well that I'll end up underperforming and be miserable anyway. Lost at the game of life from the get go, because of some shitty genetics, environment and how the game works. At this point I'm certain that killing myself is the most rational thing to do, but this isn't really the place where I could get any confirmation on that. I wish I knew where I could, but at the end of the day I know that I'll never get any closure. Why would anyone \\(that I would listen to\\) tell me to kill myself? I've had people who were assholes to me tell me not to do it. It just makes sense \\- why wouldn't they say that? How could I expect someone to suggest that out of compassion?\n\nIt feels like a bit of a tragedy for people in such situations to not even be able to get that bit of compassion. At least something to make sure that all the pondering about life and ending it was actually somewhat thought out and logical. But it's too risky, I know. No one really wants to take the responsibility or has the moral authority to really do so.\n\nI'm sorry for wasting your time. I think I just want someone to \"hold my hand\" before I \\(hopefully\\) leave this cruel world and feel pretty damn alone. I don't relate with anyone. I have no one, but even then, even if anyone bothers to try and help, I am too broken and probably will get too anxious to respond and will delete my account. Again.\n\nI feel like everything I type, say, do is oh so retarded. There is no escape. This is who I am.\n\nI will not be remembered and that's what I want \\- to make it seem I never existed in the first place. If only I could do that!\n\nBut everything's okay. Thinking about my death makes me \\(at least somewhat\\) at peace.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI recently came to a rather disturbing realization - the only thing stopping me from killing myself is my parents. They are amazing people who poured everything into raising the person I am today - good for them. \n\nI have been thinking about killing myself for a couple months now. The more I think about it, the more I realize that my parents don't deserve this. The pain of knowing they their only child committed suicide far outweighs my desire to actually follow through with it. \n\nI'm currently 24, I'm a fucking failure as a human being, and that is no exaggeration. I have no motivation, I have no passion, just nothing. I'm in law school but every day I feel like I'm too fucking stupid to do this shit. I can't even bring myself to go to class even though my parents pay absurdly high amounts of money for this shit. My personality is garbage - I'm a complete narcissist and almost all my behavior stems from wanting to \"prove\" something about myself. As if anything I say or do is like another puzzle piece to add onto this image I want to construct of myself. I'm so unbelievably insecure, incompetent, and unmotivated. \n\nPretty much just posting on here just to vent - obviously I can't say this shit to my real life friends. I think about killing myself pretty much everyday - it's almost like a feeling of relief to me when I fantasize about putting a bullet through my brain.\n\nMy parents are currently 60. My mom's going through a lot, realistically, she's gong to be out within 10 years. My dad's a healthy dude overall, physically and emotionally, but he smokes - I don't see him going past 75. It's a shitty, shitty situation to think about. I love them more than anything in the world, so I'll ride this shit out for another 10-20 years if necessary.\n\nAnyways, it is what it is. Don't know where else to post this. Just needed to vent. \n\nI hope everyone's having a great Saturday so far. :)",

Literally on the cusp of doing it but I didn't, why? I don't know. I don't want to reach out for help, I don't want people to know, I don't want anyone to stop me but I can't go through with it. I'm listening to my scratchy Bob Dylan cassette, listening to our song. Two years since we parted but I can't stop thinking of you. I don't blame you, I don't do this to spite you, I still love you. But it's this massive overwhelmingly feel of gutteral despair I can't shake. So many times I've been dismissed, \"it's just a girl\", but they don't know. You don't know. Before I met you I was at an immensly self destructive point in my life, I was certain I would die one way or another in that time and I didn't mind. But you, you gave me purpose, reason to strive to be something more, to get clean. I did my damnedest, but I know it was hard on you being with me, and I understand that you weren't happy and we went our separate ways. It's just, without you I don't have that purpose, that reason. I don't know what to do, in the two years since it ended I've done nothing in my life. Just kind of sat stagnant and I hate my self for that, I can't help but feel a sense of envy and resentment to know that you're doing well, seeing other people. I haven't been on so much as a date since we ended, which I don't hold against you, be happy, but it's hard for me to know of. I know I have mental health issues and they've slowly been getting worse since my early teens, I hope you forgive me for how I was when we dated. My mental health isn't an excuse but a partial explination, a lot of it is on me. I can't explain it, I want to go through with but I have this nagging feeling that something will happen, a sudden sign I shouldn't will arise. But it hasn't, and I have to face it won't, it's just my self absorbed nature to think I'm significanct enough for anything to intervene, my own hubris. I need you to know I love, I never stopped, forever and always to the moon and back. \n\n\nAlways sorry and indecisive, Mouse.",

I thought I was finally getting better, I didn't feel happy but I no longer spent my entire day thinking about killing myself. I started talking to friends about how I felt and stopped self harming. But this last week something snapped and it's like all of the progress I had made towards getting better came crumbling down. I've spent the last week thinking more and more about finally ending it. I feel like the friends I was using for support have all gotten kind of tired of hearing me complain about my problems and I should just do them a favor and kill myself so they never have to listen to my whining again. What makes it all worse is that I know that I'm too much of a pussy to actually go through with anything that has a high chance of succeeding and that just makes me hate myself even more. ",

            "selftext": "Tired of living in hell (russia), was too tired before my arrest, now 8 months after that **I'm just totally broken.** I'm in the middle of nowhere, a suspect in a criminal case without crime event. Because I've messed with some influential bastard, who has connections in police.\n\nI've been arrested by 6 operatives (like a fucking terrorist/murderer or something), bashed in asphalt, tortured in police dept and forced to sign papers, means I'm guilty. But there are no crime event, the case is fabricated. It was really easy for them, because I have an asthma and survived few transient ischemic attacks in past (problems with brain blood vessels, so any kind of stress may lead to irreparable damage) and they said If I'll die there they don't care (in police dept), they wouldn't call an ambulance. \n\nNow I have one of the best lawyers (spent a lot of money) in my city and not sure it will help. Due to fucked up russian laws preliminary investigation of my case may be prolonged infinitely and whole situation are limited only by statute of limitations (6 years). So yes, they can fuck me up to 6 years (endless interrogations) even if they fail to condemn me (that depends on how much money that influential bastard will pay to police/prosecutor/judge).\n\nI have a GF, she is an angel. She didn't left me in trouble. And she's the only one who really cares and worries about me. We planned to have kids in the end of 2017, but all our plans now ruined. This shit also affected my relatives (mother and grandparents especially) badly (health problems).\n\nFriends? Forget such a word. They disappeared when I got in trouble.\nThis is the most painful. When it's OK you fell like you have someone who'll support you and who cares, but the reality is infinitely heartless.\n\nI just want to leave russia (no respect to this \"country\") and to start a new and normal life in a normal country, where things like that are impossible. This country are already turned into stalins-like USSR and it becoming worse day by day. \n\n**I just want to live calmly and start a family, is it so much?**\n\nThe problem is that I NEED TO LEAVE BUT its almost impossible. This criminal record may turn into an indestructible wall on my way, because governments prefer \"not to deal with criminal scum\". I need to leave and take my GF with me. As fast as possible.\n\nI see it as a one and only cure and chance to survive.\n\nI'm stronger than I thought, but everything has it's limit.\n\nI'm broken. Can't laugh at jokes, don't enjoy anything (sports/movies/TV shows/games/most of the music I loved/even fucking driving! I used to love it so much, now I'm like a fucking automotive AI), I feel dead inside, like my life stopped, like I'm just mechanically existing like a thing, not like alive creature. And this lasts 8+ months. My body hurts (especially hands and back) for no reason, I can't enjoy life.\n\nI was so cheerful and simple-minded, naive person. I was able to feel happy just because there is a sunny day, fresh wind, because I was caught in the rain, because we was cooking something tasty together with my GF, just because she's near me and I can hold her hand, just going to walk together and talking all night.. Now it\u2019s all gone.. I\u2019m turned into some unfeeling piece of shit, and it hurts me and her so much..\n\nI don\u2019t need anything, I don\u2019t need money, a fancy car, huge house, cool dress, and all this shit. I was a person who knows what\u2019s really important in life. \n\nI had many thoughts about suicide and other bad stuff, sometimes I felt better and thought I left all this behind, but it's not true. It's not true, due to I'm still in the middle of nowhere. I don't know how this situation would resolve, I have no future, I can't plan anything, I lost all my motivation, can\u2019t work with same productivity, losing time and money because of that.  It's the worse shit in the world, when you can't leave it behind and start building your life from ruins.\n \nYOU JUST CAN\u2019T LEAVE IT BEHIND BECAUSE IT\u2019S FUCKING CONTINIUES AND MAY CONTINUE FOR YEARS.\n\nThis uncertainty is killing me slowly. And I feel worse day by day,\n\n**Thing that I'm afraid so much is that the line between idea of suicide and actual act are becoming thinner day by day**. I'm not even afraid of killing myself as it was before. Suicide seems more like a rational and positive action. Even some scary things like just getting a knife and cutting a carotid artery are not scary anymore.\n\nI don't want to, but I'm just too tired and have no strength and resources to stand this out.. \n\nI want to get out of this prison(russia) and suicide seems like an option.\n",

Recently, over the past three years, my girlfriend has helped to pull me out or to be my safety net.\n\nHowever, last time was too much. She was pushed too far. She left and I felt alone and helpless. Like I couldn't do it. That's when I ended up in the mental health unit.\n\nSince coming out I have been up and down. I have thought many times about ending my life. Two nights ago I made a load of audio recordings to the people closest to me and put them on a USB drive and online storage to be opened after I'd ended it. The plan was to get drunk and jump off a bridge. I contacted a friend to see if he fancied a drink and we drank and I opened up and he made me feel like I didn't want to go through with it. So, I didn't.\n\nToday, I am feeling like following up on the plan. Ending it all because I see no future or purpose. I can't see a point in which I will ever be happy again.",

He's not my dad and he never will be. He just turns my mom against me. Or maybe it is my fault, I put her in the middle of all this make her feel like shit. Had a stupid fucking kid who can't even fucking smile. \n\nThe only other person I have is my boyfriend. We met on Reddit, he's perfect. He's sat through so many panic attacks, but we're 16 and 17 he shouldn't be dealing with that.  We see each other every month which is nice but he forgets about me a lot. He's so supportive and I feel so guilty because all I do is this shit and I truly don't know what he sees in me.\n\nI've gone to the counselor twice. They put me on Prozac a couple days ago. They gave me panic meds that aren't working. My boyfriend told me he made these new friends and played video games with them all day. Pretty much just forgetting I was here. I kept asking him to try and keep his weekend free, I'm alone completely alone because that stupid fuck took my mom camping. So I'm here completely alone. I just wanted to be able to skype with him so I wasn't totally alone and to hear that sent me over the edge. He asked me to say I was okay so he didn't have to worry. I lied.\n\nI'm so tired I just want this day to end. I went to my moms room. She has an unloaded pistol and I just held it to my head. Pulled the trigger. Click. Then I held his loaded one, put it back down. Settled for cutting instead. \n\nI can't go on like this. The attacks are getting to be too much and I know they both can move on. He has a lot of friends, she has her boyfriend. I'm shit anyway. Now I just need the courage to pull the trigger on that loaded one ",

I don\u2019t have any friends and I hate talking to people so I always just listen to music every time I have to be out in public. My GPA is going to shit and all I really do anymore is sit around in my room and look at youtube or reddit all day. I\u2019ve gone out to this bridge in the city I live in just to do some planning and they\u2019ve got a suicide fence or whatever up on the sides and the bridge might not be tall enough anyway. So I\u2019ve been thinking about just overdosing on something or buying a gun. The only reason I haven\u2019t done it yet is because I can\u2019t hurt my mom and Dad like that. They\u2019ve worked so hard to try and raise me correctly and they\u2019re practically paying for most of my college but I\u2019m just such a lazy piece of shit. I\u2019m probably just gonna end up getting a minimum wage job and living in a shitty apartment until they die and trying to get high on the weekends or something so I can have a few moments of happiness by myself. Then when they die I can finally be free of this shit.",

I'm not attractive enough to get a girlfriend. \n\nSo each day I just sleep a lot and hope I will eventually die of old age at like 80 or 90 years old.\n\nI'm too afraid to kill myself, I can only handle it if I die of old age or natural causes. I accept that I will live a lonely life till I'm dead. \n\nBut I am optimistic about the universe and the afterlife. I think the universe gets better with time. I love being me and thank god for that. But I'm ready for death right now, so I sleep till I eventually die of natural causes. \n\nI guess the main thing is I consider myself dead just waiting to go to a place better than heaven. \n\nI mean I live a life the rich do. I got all the music rich people do, all the movies rich people do, all the sexual experiences rich people have. Porn is basically the same as sex with a real person. \n\nI'm too afraid to kill myself earlier. Make no mistake that life is hard but the universe is infinite. I will live forever. I just consider myself dead right now. Waiting for what happens after death. \n\nI'll just live at my parents house till I die and never work. I get disability, so I have some spending money. \n\nI look at all the people working and realize they are totally different than me, they have different free will. Maybe I am lucky to have given up. I mean if you look at it, I am no sadder than a rich celeb. ",

Not about anything in particular.... well i guess ill start with my life. I was adopted at birth because my mother dodnt want me and my father never admitted i was his, she was 16 he was 19. The family i was adopted into was a nice family..... but they divorced when i was 3 and thats when my problems began. I started acting out and became a \"problem\" child...... after a few years of that i started to feel nothing. One day i was a angry and somewhat happy kid..... the next i felt nothing..... at all. That was 8 years ago and ive only ever felt anything for one person..... the love of my life niamh odonnell...... god shes perfect in every way..... but im dragging her down..... i dont let her get close to me because of what happened (im not ready to talk about it) and last week is when i wipped up this plan...... to hang myself in the park that i loved as a child live for however many people wanted to watch..... atleast i can go out making some people feel something. Im not going to leave a note to anyone or anything but Niamh.... the only reason im second guessing myself is because of her...... i dont want to make her start hurting herself again..... i made her promise that she would never hurt herself because of something i did but i dont think she understood why i asked her....... god forgive me.\n\nNiamh if your reading this and im gone i just want you to know i love you so much and this had nothing to do with you..... infact it almost stopped it.\n\n If i am still alive and you are reading this, i still love you and you stopped this from happening.\n\n\n\n-anon, age 16",

I guess being suicidal is just a joke. I guess that Im an entitled fag who thinks he\u2019s better than her (asst. told a customer that she has a fag working for her) like what is the point. Why even try to tell someone you need a day to yourself because your suicidal, why even bother? Like I know people understand, but it\u2019s those few that just make me want to end it ",

            "selftext": "First time posting anything on reddit, wish it had been under better circumstances than this but oh well.\n\nAnyways my backstory is that I am a 19 year old male that has suffered from bad social anxiety for the vast majority of my life. All throughout high school I was scared to go to parties where there would be more than a few people because I didn\u2019t want my social anxiety/awkwardness to get in the way and make me seem like even more of an idiotic loser than I already make myself out to be. Somehow I managed to get through high school and 2 weeks after graduating I left for the Army, and for once I actually kinda truly enjoyed something in my life. But as life would turn out I got injured during training and was medically discharged last month after serving only 9 months of my 6 year contract. Once I was put on medical hold I was treated like utter shit by just about everyone, and as you can imagine this didn\u2019t go so well for my state of mind and it quite frankly destroyed me mentally. Throughout the agonizing months as a medical holdover awaiting discharge I never went to see anyone about my depression, mainly because I feared what might happen and how it might affect my future civilian life, and the thought of that absolutely terrified me. So now here I am back in the civilian world labeled a \u201cdisabled vet\u201d at the age of 19 feeling mentally drained and depressed every single day. I am set to start college this upcoming fall but in all honesty I just don\u2019t know about this life anymore. I\u2019m tired of hearing the same things like \u201cYou\u2019re  so young, you shouldn\u2019t be worrying about stuff like that\u201d or \u201cthings will get better once you go to school or get a job.\u201d I\u2019m always told to go out and make new friends but every time I try I just end up making a fool of myself. The few friends that I had moved away to college and don\u2019t care too talk to me anymore, and every attempt I\u2019ve made at getting to know a girl has been an absolute failure. I just feel like a weak worthless man who doesn\u2019t have any talent, has never had an actual relationship, and fails at every attempt in advancing in life. Believe me when I say that I would have pulled the trigger long ago, however I fear that my suicide would break my mothers and grandparents heart and I really don\u2019t want my depression to affect their lives as it has affected mine.I don\u2019t really know what I hope to get out of typing this or if anyone really cared enough to read through it all, but I\u2019m honestly just in the stage of staying up every single night debating about whether or not I should stay and fight or just push the off button. Any insight or advise would be appreciated, and I\u2019m typing this on mobile at midnight so forgive the inevitable spelling and grammar errors I\u2019ve made.",

            "selftext": "I tried to kill myself a few months ago. Obviously it didn\u2019t work. I spent one day in the hospital and then they sent me home. It was a truly awful experience. I learned a lot about the people in my life that night and the following day. The months since I\u2019ve learned even more. My friends and family don\u2019t understand mental illness at all being at the forefront of my new knowledge. Some of them try but they give up when the water gets a little cloudy. \n\nFor the few weeks following my attempt I was miserable but somehow I managed to get myself out of bed long enough to clean my apartment. I felt better, I had a small amount of progress. I was able to see some semblance of a future. I even was able to leave the house with a friend. It didn\u2019t last long. \n\nThe people that had been attempting to help all disappeared. My texts from family stopped coming. I lost contact with any friends I had left. I stopped trying to maintain myself and my apartment. I stopped forcing myself to get out of bed. I started eating only what I could get delivered and drinking soda. I\u2019ve only left my apartment one time in the last few weeks. I\u2019ve even run out of medication and my fear of leaving the house to get more is overwhelming. \n\nIt seems any progress I have made in my life has disappeared. I feel like a baby. I can\u2019t do anything for myself. I don\u2019t know why my fianc\u00e9 is still here. He doesn\u2019t seem to even notice how bad things have gotten. He seems uninterested in anything besides video games and random tv shows. I suppose he was always that way though. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say with all of this is that I\u2019m alone and more depressed than ever. The only option that makes sense to me is suicide. It\u2019s become more than just an option actually, I want it more than anything. I know better than to think I could ever be happy. I\u2019m 31, I\u2019ve tried 100 different ways to better myself. Nothing worked. I\u2019m out of energy. I think I\u2019m done. I want death, I want quiet, I want nothingness. \n\nI\u2019m going to do it right this time. \n\nThank you for allowing me to write this. I\u2019m not sure why I have. Someone besides me should know how I feel. I have no one else to tell. ",

I bought some rope on amazon and wrote my suicide note. I stopped going to all my classes, stopped doing homework assignments, also skipped an exam on thursday. I think I have lost almost 10 pounds from 135 ish to about 125 from eating one meal per day. Maybe more, I haven't actually weighed myself. I've been going to sleep early in the morning and waking up during the afternoon for most days. This friday on the 13th, I went out to buy some alcohol. Everything was all set, but my rope did not arrive today when it was supposed to. The mailroom is also closed on sundays so I'll have to wait until monday. Although it delays my death, I can't help but feel annoyed I don't get to die sooner. Just wanted to vent this inconvenience and not really looking to have my mind changed.",

            "selftext": "I just need to rant about this, and I usually don't talk about suicide. I do everything in my power to not think about it. But at times I'm very, very suicidal.\n\n In reality, dying is the last thing I want. But when my mental/life struggles turn into an existence worse than hell, suicide seems like the only option to escape the horrible and intense pain.\n\nNearly everyone I've been talking with always reply with something along these lines: \"Don't do it! That's so selfish of you, how can you just leave your family, friends, job and dog down? To be honest.. you're just mean.\"\n\nWhy not give love and support? Don't get angry or blame a suicidal person, it's incredibly rude. Don't judge someone who is suicidal unless you've known and felt the ENTIRETY of their struggles.\n\nAlright, so apparently I'm selfish and mean because I want to commit suicide? Of course, we all know that people who knew you would most likely be heartbroken. And again, I really don't want to die or do that to my family or friends.\n\nI know I have all the potential in the world as someone who is only 18, but the suffering is just too much. I feel hopeless, completely broken and yes, suicidal(not always). Though of course, it goes mostly unnoticed by most the people in my life. \n\nWhy the actual fuck is a suicide/suicide attempt/suicide threats so \"egoistic\"? We're not talking about an individual \"attempting\" or threatening about it, though if you make it all up to get attention and it's just bullshit, then fuck you for making people doubt/disbelieve other people who are actually suicidal.\n\nI don't believe suicide is selfish. First of all, it's technically a choice. But in most cases, it's intensely depressing. It's fucked up. It's a tradegy. No contempt or blame should be put on the person who had commited suicide. \n\nSure, you leave the people who love you behind and all, but if someone goes to the point where they actually wants to commit suicide, they're most likely suffering a LOT. People usually don't realize that you've been suffering that much before it's far too late, unfortunately.\n\nIf I'm threatening suicide, it's because I want others to know and be aware of it, and those usually hearing it is the ones that can help me. If I just go and die, without any letter or anything, I could. Nobody can stop someone who is 100% determined to kill themselves, and there's too many easy ways to end it.\n\n*So I don't think suicide is a selfish choice. We didn't choose to be born either.*\n\n**tl;dr: Please stop hating on people who's suicidal. Be friendly and give them love and support instead.**",

I've never had a girlfriend, or really even a close friend because of how strict my parents are. Never been allowed to have a phone with data, or hang out with freinds and I basically stopped using social media because of how they would monitor it etc.etc. Overall I just feel really disconected and unwanted. I honestly dont know why im even saying this seeing that no one here actually cares and even if they did it would never lead to a meaningful or intimate relationship.( Also my lack of social skills makes me afraid of speaking with people online). I understand that having a girlfriend wouldn't fix all of my problems but I still always crave the affection and attention that I see people in relationships get and give. And I know that even after I move out, it will be a long time before I can have the kind of relationship I really want. So honestly why bother?",

            "selftext": "For almost a year now, I have been depressed, my emotions range from feeling like complete shit and wanting to die, to at the best feeling very neutral. I\u2019m in a borderline abusive living situation without my father that I legally cannot change until I turn 18 in a year. Tonight is prom night, but nobody wants me there so I\u2019m stuck at home in my house with shitty ac making it impossible for me to sleep. Because of a concussion a long ass time ago, I have a neck problem I\u2019m trying to see a doctor for that causes me constant pain and discomfort along with shoulder, knee and elbow injuries that cause constant pain simply going through my daily routine. Try to do something fucking decent for myself in starting to work out. Shoulders destroyed. Same thing with running, knees in pain as I walk and even as I roll around in my bed. I haven\u2019t had a day where I\u2019ve woken up and been happy to see the sun rise in what feels like a lifetime. Physically, I\u2019m in constant pain. Emotionally, I\u2019m battered by my mother who has borderline personality disorder. I get constantly roasted and looked down on because of my dumbfuckery early in high school.  I should be going to my dad\u2019s for the summer in a few months, but Can\u2019t fathom a scenario where I last this long feeling this way. It seems as if the \u201cmeh\u201d days are becoming less common and giving way for times where I feel like this. I play video games with my few friends not because I really enjoy them now, but because they take my mind off of all my shit and they allow me atleast a bit of socialization. On top of it all, I go to a school with one of the hardest curriculums in the state, hooray!!! I even tried someone\u2019s weed and drank some alcohol, neither were able to make me feel good even for a moment. I\u2019m truly clueless about what I\u2019ll do moving forward. I don\u2019t really even know what I\u2019m doing posting on this",

Then I met a girl named Emma. Everything was great for a week, then life said \u201cFuck You\u201d too me and took her away also, every 6 months I am happy for a week then it is taken away, and I am done this time. Cutting does not work, the suicide hotline just wants to call my parents, and im done, with it all. If i get the balls to do it some night when I feel the most alone, I will end it all.

            "selftext": "Let me start off with my story. I\u2019m currently a sophomore in college. Back in my senior year of high school is where this starts. I was gifted swimmer and medaled at state every year from my freshman year in the 100 Fr. I even started getting offers for college. All of a sudden though around summer of going into my senior year I started getting these horrible back spasms and pains. This lead to me going to at least 25 doctors around my state. I got diagnosed with degenerative discs and I had one that was buldging. This forced me to end swimming competitively and end any hopes of swimming in college. I was devastated and still have physician therapy. I\u2019m 6\u20194 220 so not a small guy lol.\n\nAt the end of summer I started selling bitcoin for PayPal and ended up getting scammed $2400 total among three people. This really put me in some financial strain the first and second semester of my freshman year and college and made me really sad. I eventually made it back after hard work with an actual job irl but it sucks.\n\nDuring November of my first semester freshman year during thanksgiving break probably my best friend I had in college got in a car accident and passed away. He was only 19. I was devastated when told this and this disrupted one of my friend groups. I also didn\u2019t get a bid from the frat I wanted so my social life was in the gutter for a few weeks till i reconnected with some friends. To this day though I still haven\u2019t really told anyone about it and it haunts me every once in a while.\n\nOver Xmas break of this year I went in to get tested for sleep apnea as I snore very loud. The results were worse then we expected and I have a very severe case and have a cpap machine and may have to get surgery too. It\u2019s a struggle when talking to girls or having one spend the night as I don\u2019t want to bring it up lol. The doctor said I was sleeping 1/2 as good as the normal person and less than 1% of people that have sleep apnea at my age have it as bad. I\u2019m not overweight by any means at all and lift and workout everyday.\n\nI also live in a more affluent part of town but I just have parents that made good financial decisions and only give me what I need. All my friends and kids around me tho are spoiled and never work so it\u2019s been a real burden when it feels I\u2019m not as good and poor relative to them. I work and don\u2019t spend time with them. My parents say we live in a \u201cbubble\u201d but its still hard to see otherwise being the only kid working and doing other stuff my friends do.\n\nWith the intense pressure of school this year it\u2019s been a struggle and I\u2019ve had thoughts about killing myself bc I feel like everything bad happens to me. And I have shit luck. I\u2019ve never followed through with any thoughts but I feel it\u2019s getting worse and worse. What\u2019s holding me back is my friends and family bc I don\u2019t want to let them down. But it starts to mean less and less the more I think about it.",

However how is a life full of disappointment, pain, suffering, agony and despair a life at all? How is that a life worth living? My life is not a movie, so I can't change the script. My life is not a video game, so I can't  hit restart. My life is what it is, whether I like it or not. So the only question left to ask is to live a lie or die a truth?

I wonder why almost all classmates/peers get to live atleast lifes worth living while I'm getting this dysfunctional brain that turns reality into a horror game for me lately. My classmates are worried that their boyfriend/girlfriend might leave them or that they will suck at that next chemistry test. I'm sitting here hoping that those creatures won't kill me and go away again. Odd considering I want to die and want to kill myself because of the intense fear, but those things petrify me. It's really hard seeing normal and happy people, it's just destroys me. Depressed since I was 13 to 14 years old, strongly depressed and somewhat suicidal since the half of 2017. Now 16 years old.\n\nNow I'm just really easy to piss off, strong mood swings, emotionless and getting visual and auditory hallucinations (fucking terrifying humanoid creatures or sometimes just faces in the dark when going to sleep or shadow beings) that startle the shit outta me and making me paranoid and uncomfortable in my own room. I'm so fucking petrified by those. One appeared once under my desk when I sat there and it crawled towards me... I pissed myself. It had pitch black eyes, white skinny body, long sharp nails and huge sharp teeth. Starting to feel like some demons are after me and want to kill me/abduct me. I'm so scared and I'm living in constant fear of those.\nLuckly those hallucinations have reduced drastically over last few days. I hope this shit goes away completly or atleast is only caused by depression and not some other neurological/psychological disorder.\n\n**Why me? Or why do people have to endure those psychological/neurological disorders in general? It's so cruel and I just want to die now because of this intense fear**",

            "selftext": "I was born almost 19 years ago. On Apgar score I had almost none. My mom cried a lot. She got to see me after a couple of weeks. They told her my brain was damaged but they couldn't diagnose how. They said I would be delayed if not retarded but at least alive.\nMy mom and dad did everything to make sure I developed well. I did a nice job and turned out to be an average kid. I think.\nI have this feeling like I've never been happy. I was always an anxious and neurotic person. I worried about everything. When I entered my early teens I suffered a lot of bad breakdowns. I would cry and cry and cry for no reason. I was lonely, had social anxiety and thought I'd never make it in life. I spent my time on the internet. There wasn't any connection to the real world. I didn't care how it worked. I was comfortable around my internet friends.\nAfter some time - mid teens I met my first boyfriend. It was at a Christian camp organised by our church. Our parents have been friends for years then but we only met twice before the camp. He was the opposite of me. I was shy and he was this guy that everyone loved for his wit. We met because I showed him some memes and he finally found a person who understood him. \nWe've been dating for 1,5 years. Up till last month.\nWe had many arguments, misunderstandings and bad times but besides that we loved eachother. He was my first in many ways. Especially my first happy time. I've never felt so nice in my life. I didn't know a person could feel genuinely happy. That it doesn't have to be forced. I thought he would propose someday and that I could share my future with him.\nAnd then he says he doesn't feel anything for me anymore.\nOuch.\nI haven't been the same person for the last 3 weeks. I constantly have to be around people. Especially my parents. I get really lonely when I'm by myself. I don't eat, I don't sleep, I cry way too much. I have no energy to do things. I went back to my previous self. The one who didn't know what happiness is. I'm afraid it's just how I am. That depression is who I am. I have considered suicide for the past month. Every night I can't sleep thinking about him. I want to be a strong person. I don't want to hurt him. I'm impulsive and words just slip out of my mouth. I text compulsive messages. I want to stop but I don't know what to do. \nI've always felt suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But depression has never been temporary. It always comes back. I can't live like that. \nI got pills prescribed. They don't help. I feel pissed at myself and my body for not absorbing them properly. I could die any moment and I wouldn't care. I just don't want to suffer anymore. Last 7 years were especially hard. It's gotten better and then suddenly went back to how it was during the worst times. I don't cope. I don't know how at this point. I have no support. I feel like only solution would be to just end it. ",

            "selftext": "I pretty much have to quit my job because i dont have a car, and my carpooling neighbor that is my coworker quit because of bullshit assault allegations looming over her. I do not have one lined up even though i do have options. This scares me because I stupidly didn\u2019t think about taxes all year (self employed subcontractor in a grocery store, did not pay or attempt to estimate quarterly tax payments) and now I owe $1200 that ill be lucky to pay $200 of ASAP. I know my parents will help but I\u2019ve never been in nearly that much debt to anybody and that makes me feel like a guilty piece of garbage and also scares the shit out of me. \n\nI\u2019m attempting to lower that number as much as I can, fast as I can. One thing I feel I have to do in my stubborn pride is sell my guitar. It\u2019s been a good friend to me for 2-3 years now as a coping mechanism/escape when shit becomes too much, but I\u2019m not as good as I used to be, don\u2019t have the time to practice as much as I would like, and I need the money. I keep trying to look at it with a cold sense of logic. The amount of time I use it is low, the need for money is high and urgent. I can mourn it later. I don\u2019t want to, but I need to because the government wants to charge me money for stocking their shelves even though they don\u2019t pay me. They say \u201cDeath or taxes\u201d and I\u2019m inclined to choose death. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t sell my PS4 though. I wish I could play it, but I lent it to a drug dealer that was just released after 6 months in. I\u2019d offer him to gimme money so he can just keep it and my games but he\u2019s kind of a shitty dealer cuz he\u2019s always broke. He always gets his shit stolen so chances are someone will steal it from him. That\u2019s the thing\u2014 I trust he wont just run off with it or wont gimme excuses if i asked for it back, but i promised to lend it for a minimum amount of time and i don\u2019t wanna go back on it. That\u2019s just not how I am. \n\nI feel like I live in a weird spot in life. I really believe my friends all genuinely like me and that I treat them well, but they all treat eachother really horribly. I\u2019m sick of standing in the center of it all because when everyone trusts you, they all each think you\u2019re on their side. I feel like I\u2019m watching a comedy series that slowly turns into a tragedy. \n\nI couldve gone to college, with at least a decent chunk of financial aid in grants and scholarships. My dad needed to sign papers and send tax documents for enrollment purposes, but put it off so i could be home to help him around the house and with his handyman work he struggles to do by himself. I tolerate him alot more since he quit drinking, but he\u2019a a big reason for why I have little self-worth. I could go on a whole rant. Ive been trying to write a good all-around post on my feelings for this sub for hours and they all devolve into rants about him. Ive been living most of my life for him and Its made me realize how much even the hardest-working people with the best of intentions will struggle financially for the rest of their lives, both from his generation and from mine, now that I\u2019m seeing friends set to graduate and still struggling to find jobs for the future. Makes me feel that no matter where I go, what path I\u2019ll take, I\u2019ll never really be free of having to constantly owe money. Money is evil and day to day life is unforgiving. \n\nMy brother realized all this years ago. He realized all this and so he shot himself in the woods in the middle of the night. I remember he left that night, he just grabbed his keys an said see ya later when i was the only one home. I wouldve never known thats what he went out to do. I had eventually accepted it and even came to have a strong sense of sympathy for him and his choice to end his life. A few years later, my other older brother was going to rehab for heroin. The day before he did he told me that our late brother had been using in those last few months as well. Part of the reason I sympathized with his choice to end his own life was because I had believed he put considerable thought into it whilst sober and clear-headed, because that\u2019s how I would do it. But now I have to wonder if that wasn\u2019t the case and I\u2019m not sure I could accept it if it wasn\u2019t. \n\nLife just seems to be a daily struggle that nobody wants to deal with. We all wanna be proud if overcoming hardship, but are you really overcoming hardship if it keeps returning, whether its your own fault or not? I certainly don\u2019t think so, and i don\u2019t see why anyone should be shamed for wanting to not suffer. \n\nI wanna die now, but I\u2019m frustrated because I wouldn\u2019t wanna die in debt. I feel obligated to live to pay off this debt ill be in to my folks now. Ill have to get a new job both to do that and not feel like a freeloader. It\u2019ll give off a vibe of doing better cuz id likely getting more money after climbing outta debt, but itll be all the more damaging to my mother if i ended my life afterwards. I\u2019m much more concerned about her reaction than my dads because she\u2019s always been supportive of me even when i dont deserve it. It sounds disgusting when I say it or write it knowing people will see it, but I have enough of a selfish want to die that I\u2019m able to accept hurting a few people I otherwise definitely *would not want* to. But It\u2019s hard thinking about how it\u2019d affect my mom, especially after she\u2019s lost a son already. It just makes me feel worse pain that I wanna be rid of. \n\nI wish I was able to tap into my emotions more. I guess I\u2019ve cried over stupid shit so much in my life that I sunconsciously stop myself from crying because I feel stupid for it, either because its something i wanna think isnt worth crying over it because i cant help but tell myself its a waste of time and energy i could use to solve my problems. It was my most raw coping mechanism of expressing emotions and i simply can\u2019t do it anymore. I\u2019ve lost my main means of release and it just continues to bottle up and rot me from within. ",

            "selftext": "For the last two and a half years I have been feeling like shit. I hate myself and have done a lot to distance myself from those who love me. I am not taking medication of any sort, and I am not even sure if I am truly depressed or just a weak piece of shit. I just want to talk, and be heard, and the anonymity this subreddit offers me is the only reason that moves me to seek advice and help.\n\nTwo years and a half ago, because of my home country's situation and other events, I was moved to a different country. I was not given a choice, and while I am aware my parents only wanted the best for me, I still resent it. Around that time I was hurried to enter college in this new place, studying something chosen by my mother under the pretext it made money. Up to this point I look back and realize that I have not made a single decision in my life, and do not know how to feel about it. \n\nI feel inexplicably broken, and find it hard to sleep most days of the week, and loathing the moment i wake up. When I told my mom I wanted to study something else (In my first year here) she told me I was the problem, or that my perspective was the problem. Something a long the lines of \"If you have a positive outlook and try hard, you will find you will like it.\" I do not, two years a half have passed, my grades are shit, and I cannot find the motivation to improve the way I live.\n\nIt's stupid, it's moronic, and I hate myself for feeling this way. I should be grateful but I'm not, and that makes me feel worse. I should try harder, but I'm not, and that makes me hate myself. I've said countless times \"I'll try harder, I'll be better\", but the truth of the matter is that I do not know why I should try harder, or be better.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me, or why I am like this. But I know that I'm wrong, and that seems to be enough.  I've made many mistakes that I regret almost immediately after making them, and despite this, I find myself repeating them shortly after. I just hate myself so much, for being how I am. I am selfish, ungrateful, lazy, stupid, a liar and if you ask me where do I see myself in ten years, and I am honest, I'll tell you \"I have no idea\".\n\nI don't have any real problems, yeah, the situation in my country is really bad, but others are worse. No matter how many times I am told how others would kill to be in my place, that does not help me, but only makes me feel worse about myself, and how much of an idiot I am being. \n\nIf the me from three years ago saw me as I am today, he would barely recognize me. \n\nSorry for the rant, I feel i only wrote in circles, without really explaining anything, but I don't really feel comfortable talking to others, and could not properly say what I wanted to say. I didn't even believe in things like depression, was raised to believe it was all in my head, and even now I just feel like an attention seeker by putting what I feel into words.\n\nMy bad.\n\n",

I just want to dissappear and people just forget about me. Like expunge my name from the books. I just needed to rant. I cant tell that to others, my family cant keep things to themselves.",

Unless your in a situation where you feel a chronic stabbing pain I wouldn't end it. Although emotional pain is bad to and after 7 yrs and mutiple horrifying events I'm just numb to my feelings. I feel like I'm not there.

            "selftext": "I'm a 17 year old trans guy, so transitioning to male. I've always had a lot of issues with friendships, and I've always felt lonely because of it. Even in elementary school, I struggled. I only had 3 years of high school because the summer before my would-be senior year, I graduated early. Any friends I had pretty much vanished at that point. I came out to my parents that summer, and they resent me for it. I started on testosterone about a month ago and that's great, but that only helps with the physical gender-related issues.\n\nI just feel lonely. I don't have friends. And when I say that, I mean no one. I mean, I have a few online friends I talk to sometimes, but that's it. I want to hang out with people. I'd been talking to this really cute, amazing guy for about a month and a half now and I fell really hard. I just get so much hate from my parents and our society in general that when someone showed romantic interest in me I latched on. We hung out once about two weeks ago and it was really, really nice but we haven't hung out since and it seems like he's losing interest in me. He's too nice to say so, but I can tell. I'm really good at reading people. Its my fault, too. I'm obnoxious, and he's gay and I hardly look/sound like a guy. I keep asking him to hang out because I just crave being around someone who doesn't dislike me, and it ruined it.\n\nSo now I feel more alone than before, and I feel hopeless. I texted him earlier asking if he wanted to come over and smoke tonight, but he hasn't responded and I'm telling myself he's just sleeping. He works like 4/5 AM - 11/1, so he sleeps during the day a lot. I don't expect him to come, or even reply to the text. But if he doesn't come, I want to kill myself tonight.\n\nNow, obviously I'm not going to tell him that. That'd be manipulative and awful of me. But I need someone with me tonight and I don't have anyone else.\n\nIts not his fault, either. I've felt like this for a long time, but seeing him drift away like that made me realize how shit I am. I don't see how anyone could love, or even like me. I'm trans, I've got a shit personality, I'm bipolar... I just feel hopeless.\n\nSo, plan is to get high as fuck tonight with the weed I bought today, and take my stash of pills. I've been saving up leftover SSRIs/SNRIs for about a year now whenever I switched dosages/meds. Parents are out of town until tomorrow so I have plenty of time to die. I just wish I didn't always fuck everything up.\n\nEdit: Changed up my mix. Got a handful of aspirin, handful of benadryl, a good mix of celexa, Zoloft, pristiq, Prozac, hand full of motion sickness medicine and some nyquil. ",

Nothing interests me, and I have no hope for the future despite searching for a psychotherapist and having a psychiatric nurse to talk toi n the mean time. My experience with the psych ward is awful and I refuse to go back. Everyone else has others to carry them through if someone as meaningless as me disappeared.

Going back to a time before the insomnia, before the betrayal, before the cyclothymic unipolar hypomania, before the xanax, before the drugs, before all the mistakes, before the nervous breakdown and full manifestation of my bipolarity, before the memories, before the guilt, before the isolation, before the slow tick tock to my impending death.  \n\nI cared about all my friends so much, but I was so fucked from my mental health issues they quickly grew to resent me. And left. There was an amazing girl I fell madly in love with and we were like two peas in a pod, before I ruined it. I started getting better until I found out the only friend I had left had been lying to me for years.  \n\nNo matter how much I desperately want to make amends with people, I know I never can. And I'm too afraid of going out into the world again because of how spectacularly I fucked everything up before.  \n\nWhat's the fucking point",

At some point in my early to mid 20s, it kicked me in the ass again. I sat on my bed with a knife to my neck and realized it wasn't sharp enough.\n\nI battled dark thoughts into my thirties, but, I was able to keep the worst of them at Bay. Last fall, I finally went to my doctor for help. The meds did nothing but make me sleep. I didn't give a shit about anything when I was awake because I was mentally numb.\n\nI'm tired of looking for reasons not to end it. The goal in life shouldn't be to live for as long as possible. It should be to make the best of what you have, regardless of length. Quality, not quantity. I can't see the quality in mine.\n\nObjectively, it's not a bad life. I have a roof over my head, food in my belly, and a dog by my side. It's a chemical thing for me. It's not situational. My brain is broken and I'm tired of denying it.\n\nI've started looking at firearm prices the other night. I find it amusing that they seemed to be too expensive for a one time use device when I wouldn't have to pay any more bills once I'm gone. Maybe that means I'm not 100% there yet. Maybe it means I need to choose another method. I had a friend who just walked into the ocean one day. I wish I knew where to find a good cliff.",

            "selftext": "I dont like being an homo sapien, i mean i dont like How we live in a society where Expectations are really high and expected to be successful, people subconsciously judging others and the way they look. How Stupid Things go trending on the internet and those who dont keep up become Outcasts. How everything is fixed inside Our monkey brains we are Not aware off Because all what People Focus on Is Sex,drugs and violence Our evolutionary Process. Im ashamed of how Contradicting, Harmful, igronant,\nCringe worthy we are. Making Movies About Topics That happend in the real world And making Entertainment shows. Going Out to Work just to go home And watch tv repeatedly or maybe sometimes\nGo out. It Annoys me All i am in this existence is An ape My body looking for a girl so i can breed with her and start a family like everyone else. My mind fixed to my brain So that when i die It ceases to exist and i become nothing like before I was even Born. When i look around In towns and cities I see how depressed People are they dont look happy. I look at them And think we are just Cattle, being Hurded Up. I hate How There is no space And everything Is crowded, i hate how Kids my age think \u201cIm Hard me\u201d and \u201ci get pussy all the time\u201d and walk around with Bagy trousers And Clothes That trend On The internet eg Addidas, nike,etc and Speak Loudly. I believe the internet Controlls Our society Its where We get our influence from. I hate when I hear Sneaky remarks Of people Around me Who talk behind other peoples Back And say \u201cShes ugly, fat Stupid,\u201d etc it dosent feel right and makes Me Feel Awkward because When i look at them i could say the same thing I feel like people Go into a delusional Fantasy Land where they think they are immortal, sexy and everyone Loves them. Im not jelous I hardly feel anything at all. I heard Suffocation from hanging takes only 10secounds to pass out. Im planning It, in September Not November instead. I hate how i start a conversation with someone and it turns into a argument, i hate how no one Sticks up for me, i dont see a future im not bothered. ive been watching Videos On The website \u201cBest Gore\u201d i was curious what my Weightless body would look like Floating in the air then Rotting in my closet. I feel like death, ive been having nightmares Of Demons and delisional Shit, i hate having sleep paralysis at night not being able to move and feeling a dark evil presence Near me. I dont feel right my thoughts have become More violent And messed up, most of all i blame God for giving me life i wish i never existed in the first place and Im an athiest Thinking god exists, I could rant about God everyday and knock those stupid religious people off their feet and doubt their Faith.",

I hate it. People tell me I am slim and that what I\u2019m seeing isn\u2019t right, but I can\u2019t see myself any other way. I just want to be like the others girls my age, they\u2019re all so thin and tall and look like models, and I\u2019m just here all chubby and short and sad. I\u2019m so jealous of my friends, they\u2019re all so much thinner and taller than me yet talk about how they need to lose weight to fit in their prom dress. It makes me feel ashamed of myself \u2014 I feel bad enough because I know I stress my mum out a lot with my condition. She gets nervous and I know she really wants me to like my body. I feel awful that I despise it. Whenever I think about it, all I want to do is curl up and die. I stopped self harming when I was 13; I was bullied when I first went into secondary school, luckily I\u2019ve grown out of that. I was happy for so long and I\u2019ve fallen back flat again.

I'm always mildly depressed and to be honest i'm a bit optimistic about my future, in these last months.  \nAnyways, i'm not here to talk about myself and i hope this subreddit fits my request.  \n  \nEverytime someone says he wants to die, usually there's someone who answers: \"get some help\". I guess they refers to therapists and antidepressants, and my question is: do they really work?  \nI've never tried any of those so i wonder if some of you can tell me your experience. When you are depressed and you get a pill, do you really feel better? Do you feel happy? Or are you just a bit high so you won't feel any pain?  \nAlso, talking to a therapist, does it really help? What can a therapist can say that you guys in this subreddit aren't already saying to all the depressed dudes who pass by?  \n  \nThis help you are talking about is really expensive and i wonder if can really fix someone's suicidal thoughts.  \n  \nThanks for the responses.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m a man, 5\u20193-4 tall. I can\u2018t even grasp how amazing it must be to live life not being discouraged ecery single day bc of your height. I get up every morning and I hate myself. actually I dont really hate myself as a person but I truly hate the way I am, my height and the situation around it.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nso I get up and go to the train only to be towered over by a fucking school class. these people were like what, 13 years old? at this point my day is basically ruined. I cant help it, it\u2018s this void that just pulls my down and drags my mood to absolute zero. then I arrive at work and I\u2018m by far the shortest (person!) I can find. in conferences having to stand next to other people is literal torture for me. in these situations I really want to sink into the ground. it\u2018s just not fun or enjoyable anymore, in fact it never was. so then when work is completed I go hime. that\u2018s it, my life for the last 6 years. I don\u2018t enjoy going outside anymore, I hate this insanely strong feeling if inadequacy. I am not just a short guy, I am THE short guy.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nbelieve it or not but I have not seen a man my age my height or shorter in 2018. it\u2018s absolutely insane and I have said it numerous times, I would have no issue with being normal short. I am not though, I feel like a freak. and I look like a freak with my small frame and my tiny arms and my slim shoulders. I hate it.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\nand I know what other people think of it. I know what women think of it, if it\u2018s closely related to what I think about fat women, as in, being friends is a no brainer, why not if they are nice people but sexual attraction? oh god, no. if it\u2018s just related to that then I am fucked. I sometimes try to comfort myself in thinking that maybe it\u2018s not like that, maybe other people don\u2018t see being short the way I see it. but that is evidently wishful thinking and I know that very well based in personal experience.\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\nI feel so pathetic seeing other people enjoying their lives to the fullest, having families, people who went to school with me outperforming me in every way possible. feeling comfortable in their skins. but it\u2018s not just that, it\u2018s that they dont have a reason to feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nwhen I walk around I feel like an outcast. I feel like other people are not even playing the same game, it\u2018s lile a swimming race between michael phelps and my grandmother. hell, in these meetings I feel like a different species.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nand when I compare myself to other people, to other men, it\u2018s so perfectly clear why no one who is not desperate would not want to date ne. there are people just as funny, just as successful but without being so incredibly short. it really hurts, seriously.\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nmy youth, my childhood, everything I have done has been influenced by my height in some way. from the age of 15 when I first got rejected for it in a rather brutal way, which totally opened my eyes to double that age. college was terrible and I look back at it with lots of grief, I was anxious as fuck with good reason.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nI don\u2018t have a true friend who I could share this with. I feel so pathetic and it\u2018s a mixture of my own failure to get my life in order and the fact that I am so short. even if I did get it in order(the best years are completely wasted at this point) I am still 5\u20184. and every morning I am reminded of it, from getting up to getting to work to being at work feeling emasculated and unable to attract anyone. I am serious this is my life and this is why I have so much time for reddit. I am not proud of it, I dont mean to discourage anyone, especially young ones(which I have been accused if) but I cannot help it.\n\n-\n\n\nfun fact I am also balding aggressively these days(even thiigh medication helps) and I have a small dick. do I feel like a sexual being? no, not at all. like really not at all and how could I. it\u2018s a fucking joke, seriously I am so mad and frustrated to be locked up in this body. it\u2018s like god gave everyone in life a sports car and I got a rosty bike. I honestly very deeply hate my life and have no idea where I\u2018m heading at, like an airplane with a passed out pilot. genetics is the worst about our existence",

            "selftext": "I have anxiety and troubles talking to people. I've been unemployed for two years but I'm a mom and really need a job. My anxiety has kept me from turning in applications, answering phone calls from employers, returning phone calls, or showing up to interviews. \nFinally, I turned in an application. She seemed to like me and told me to come in the next day for an interview. I pulled myself out of bed to go to the interview because this job field is one that I've been dreaming of for years. This lady is interviewing me and I might finally have a chance to start what I really want. \nWell, I went to the interview and it went great. She was laid back and sarcastic, much like me. We talked for an hour. She said she wanted to go home and pray about it and talk to her husband about it but that she would let me know. \nThat was Friday. Today is Saturday. Right now I'm scared of two things happening. 1) my anxiety kicking in and I don't answer her calls or return them if she does call and want to hire me \nOr 2) she doesn't want to hire me. It didn't go as well as I thought and she doesn't like me \n\nAnd I'm terrified and aware that either or those things will probably throw me back into my recent depression slump. It's been bad lately. Like going for a drive and wanting to drive off the highway bad. Drive into water bad. Constantly thinking about how I would kill myself and what would happen after. \nI pulled myself out of this long enough to turn in that application and go to an interview but I don't know how long my \"good days\" will last. \n\nI'm just hoping my mind can hold out and be good for awhile. Maybe this could be my turn around ",

Without the music I put together while attempting to escape the horrid thoughts that plagued my mind.. I used my lyrics as a way to occupy my mind with enlightening thoughts and pull myself out of the fantasy gone bad.. anyway. Now I have almost a hundred songs and have accepted and forgiven the fact I'm capable of gross thoughts.. but I realize it is also insane. Im compulsive toward guitars. If I dont have a guitar to escape to I kinda freak out with friends at times. I'm a whole mess of crazy, but I have a decent heart attached to this chaotic mind.

The \"best\" are the answers provided by Quora users who fancy themselves as gurus. Their advice is shallow, meaningless, and all fluff but no value. Let me make it very clear that *I* know my situation far, far better than *you* ever will. Do not pretend to understand, because you do not. Do not pretend that my problem is temporary, because it's not. Do not tell me to just wait it out because it won't get better.\n\nSomeone tell me why I should have to continue living? Is it because *you* don't want to feel the guilt? Or is it because your fairy tale religious beliefs dictate that suicide is wrong and that's that, or because life is this precious gift that you can't explain how it's so? If you're a mental health professional, why can you not understand that locking up someone in a hospital ward and treating them like a prisoner isn't helpful? Why do you feel obligated to interfere with someone's right to decide their fate?\n\nLike I said in my title, I made up my mind. I don't have immediate plans but I do have a method in mind. And when the time comes, I will act. But until that time comes, I just want to know why someone should feel they have a right to interfere with anyone's choice to end their suffering. I guarantee none of you know what pain they're going through, so don't delude yourselves into thinking it will magically go away.",

Almost a year later I managed to go to get hormones (I'm trans) when I was again faced with that or suicide.\n\nOther than that, I don't talk to people I don't know. I won't go shopping if there isn't a self checkout. Even then it takes hours to get the resolve to do it. I sit down to try and apply for a better job and I spend 5 minutes searching and 45 minutes crying because the thought of having to sell myself to a group of strangers is so terrifying that I would not only willingly, but gladly run myself into the ground to avoid it.\n\nSuicide hotlines are the least helpful things on the planet. If you're not immediately a danger to yourself, all they care about is getting you off the line ASAP. Sure they might nicely tell you to go to a therapist, but then they just hang up on you. If you are a threat, all they care about is getting you off the line and into a hospital ASAP. If you refuse, they trace the call and send the cops. It's disgusting.\n\nI don't feel that I can function much longer in this world. When I have to work in the morning, I wake up with anxiety at 5 am and spend the hours until my shift desperately mustering up the courage to go. I would kill myself tonight if it wasn't for my partner who is the only person who even seems to understand.\n\nI don't even know why I bother asking here for help. I guess I want help, I try to try, if that makes sense, but there's just something inherently wrong with my brain. My mother tells me I'm just lazy but that's not the problem. I have no issues with working. I *have* a job. I'm just incapable of finding a new one and/or interacting with people during it.\n\nI have a plan and the means to carry it out. The sad truth is that only reason I'm alive is because I care more about my partner than I do about myself.",

Until my new neighbour moved in her name was Becca and she was really cute and shy (kinda got a thing for that lol) eventually after I got the courage o asked her out and she actually fucking said yes when I was with her and only when u was with her I was happy and because of her none of the other shit seemed to matter we were together up until last year when she moved away about a week after I had my first attempt I failed and that made everything worse because of the treatment money my parents had to work more they fought more and my brother hated me because now he had to work the summer just to pay uni tuition so this is the problem I want to die that\u2019s all I want but even if I do I\u2019ll be a burden on my family I\u2019ll be potentially ruining my brothers life so even though I want to die I can\u2019t I\u2019m just trapped in this sick fucking cycle would it work if I ran away so they couldn\u2019t find my body? And left it in my note not to look for me or have a funeral? Idk I just need to know how I can die without being a burden on the people I love ",

Worthless.\n\nI'm just totally worthless.  Nobody in Flordia believes that I'm reformed.

I have. Ever been to a point were you just can't help yourself anymore ? You've tried your hardest but failed at life , never being able to get married , have your own kids , have your own house , Owe how I wish. I grew up switching schools my whole life , I didn't graduate , of course, didn't have the same friends for more than a year because my parents got divorced when I was 6 and I moved back and forth my whole life. I don't really have any good childhood memories , I have a few good times , but they didn't last long, I was always that quiet kid in school, I stayed to myself. I tried to focus on my school work but I was always missing a lot of days because of parent custody reasons. But somehow I made it to high school , 9th grade, I lived with my dad , we had a lot of fun , we would race go karts on the weekend, that's really the only good memories I have with my dad, he did buy me things I wanted growing up , but I think that's because he just wanted me to live with him so he wouldn't have to pay child support , and because he wanted me to forget about the night he tried to murder my mom when we was in our driveway when I was 6, when they was going through the divorce. He was hiding behind a building and jumped in the car with a knife to my mother's throat, that was a bad day , but I'm not gonna tell my whole life story, it's pretty boring and I'm sure y'all don't wanna hear it. When I was 16 my dad kicked me out of the house , that was the 1st time I was homeless , he locked the doors on me and put my clothes in a trash bag and told me not to come back, I slept in a broken down car in the yard for about 2 days,that was the 1st time I thought about suicide, my brother. Which is about 4 years older than me let me stay at his \u201chouse\u201d for a couple weeks, wasn't really a house it was a camper he was renting from a guy and living there, he couldn't afford to feed me everyday so he had to take me back to my dad where I wasn't welcomed , when I went back to my dads I wasn't aloud in the house, so he put a small hunting camper in the yard and told me that's where I live now , I lived in that camper for about 2 weeks with no water or bathroom so if I had to go #2 I had to do it in the woods , it was one of the lowest points in my life, and my dad was wrong for doing that. I would never do my children like that, If I ever had any. My aunt and grandma found out how I was living and came and got me , they lived 6 hours away, so I moved in with my grandma and my mom , the 1st day I was up here I seen my mom smoking crack in her room , I was already in a bad spot so you know how that went for me , she later got locked up for violating her probation because she failed her piss test, she went to jail and been locked up ever since. My grandma doesn't have a lot of money , we live in a trailer , sometimes go without food , well I do , because I feel bad if I eat her few items she has in the kitchen. But I did find a minimum wage job when I came up here , and I have a vehicle I saved up for , it barely makes it around. I make just enough to get by at this job. But today I overslept and got fired. My grandma can barely support herself , better yet me and her. So I know I am screwed. I'm not gonna be able to find another job , I'm lucky I had the one I had. I smoke weed to decline my loneliness so I know I can't pass a drug test. But today , today is the day I took my life, I don't want to be homeless again , you may think I'm a coward for taking my own life , but I feel like I have no choice, I have nobody , besides my grandma and my aunt , but they will understand. They know I had it ruff. I don't know how I'm gonna do it yet. I'm not gonna make a bloody mess in my grandmas trailer, and I may not do it today , who knows,  But i'll find a easy way. This isn't my suicide note, I just want people to know how my life went , I didn't tell everything. But I don't have time. I have to go. Today is the day I take my life. \n\n",

My sleep schedule is continuously changing, I have nightmares every time I sleep, even if I wake up and fall back asleep I will have bad dreams. The thoughts of taking any pills/any method are constantly absorbing me. I haven't tried anything yet, I am too exhausted to even try. I haven't left my home in 2 years. I m losing it again, my brain is like fishing for methods to die. I need help. I can't leave my home to visit a therapist and no therapist will come to me to help me. \nMy parents are in fight constantly, I am 19 and I can't remember when they just 'talked' with each other without bullying the other. They need to get divorce but they won't. My dad helps me, takes care while my mom does it too but she has own psychological problems which cause her to be paranoid about everything and i sometimes can't tolerate her. I love them both but I can't keep picking sides every other day while living under the same roof.\nI have no friends, I have ceased all my contact to them. I am basically watching TV series,movies all day(10-16hours/day) for 2 years to get me out of my world. Whenever I realise the reality I am living in, I want to kill myself. That's why I keep watching on internet so I won't do that. It makes me forget about myself but I don't know for how much longer I can keep that. Trust me, being at home, watching TV all day while your parents work for you while you leech off them isn't as it may seem. I have few personality disorders like social anxiety, OCD,etc from Cluster B and C(I had professional help 2 years ago). I was basically a very ambitious person getting staright A's(always 90+%) right through 11th, I dropped out on 12th grade due to depression. I somehow completed high school through open schooling but that's it, I can't go to college and have a proper work life like every other person. I lost all my ambition, hope, motivation to live. Now I am like a parasite trying to leech off life wherever possible (only if I live). Please don't tell me go out, make some friends, etc. I can't and I don't want to. I just want it to stop.

            "selftext": "That's pretty much it. Some of my relatives are making my life a financial hell (and then wondering why I only fucking work - I fucking have to pay the bills and shit for fucks sake). Make no mistake though I am as well not helping it, I'm not living frugally by any means, I buy games on steam to \"fill the void\" and generally eat take out and all that (mostly because I can't cook, also I work a lot - 70-80 hours a week for past few months, with chronic insomnia its easy to do that), but the whole thing with supporting my relatives makes it impossible for me to live normally. There's always this next fucking thing I have to pay for and its not like they're taking vacations 24/7, its just normal life - groceries, healthcare, occasional emergencies. \n\nBut now they've come up with an investment plan and its a sound one, no jokes. But in order to execute it, they'll have to risk pretty much all my liquid savings for about a year. I will be literally penniless for a while, i.e. have no money saved up and I'll have to either negotiate a raise or lower my expenses to deal with this shit and while the former is definitely on my list since I've been busting my ass at work for the past I don't even fucking know how long, the latter I'm definitely not looking for. \n\nI've been living a reserved life for a long time now, I didn't buy myself clothes, didn't buy that dream fucking PC I always wanted to have, didn't go on a vacation to Ibiza, I only recently started taking care of myself somewhat - I'm losing weight right now for example and I've started being really active, even thought about buying that gym membership finally. \n\nAnd now I'll have to cut down on all expenses potentially for a year because not only will I have to pay the loan percentages until my relatives can cover it, but I will also have to save like crazy to restore my savings in case I lose my job suddenly. \n\nIf I didn't love them I would just told them to go fuck themselves, but I do love them and I don't want to stomp on their dreams and hopes, they lost a lot financially because of economical crisis in my country, pretty much 80% of their net worth went down the drain and that was in their 60s, on top of that they lost a lot of their health as well. \n\nI'm just so tired to be honest, a lot of people depend on me, but it feels like I'm about to get crushed by this weight. I think about it all the fucking time, in some parallel universe I could've been a happy person - successful young(-ish, I'm pushing 30) engineer, but I'm stuck here, in this shitty country, with those people. And worst of all - I'm completely alone in this, nobody gives a fuck or understand my struggles with life, nobody ever did - people just dismiss it as whining if I try to explain. And maybe they're right - fuck me and my life. ",

Instead, I continue push myself because I want a fulfilling life...something I can enjoy. I can remember being 12 and plotting my own death. Eight years later, and things have only gotten worse when it comes to my mental health. To be honest, I\u2019m not even sure my depression is the main issue. I long for more social contact, but my social anxiety is out of control. I try so hard to branch out. I\u2019ve forced myself to join clubs and whatnot, but I still feel so lonely and empty. What\u2019s worse is that substance abuse has filled that void. It\u2019s funny though because I\u2019ve been suicidal and depressed for the better part of the past five years, but up until 2016 I was heavily against any kind of illegal drug use. Within the past week I have dropped acid on three separate occasions, and to be honest with you that\u2019s about the only time I smile. I downloaded a sobriety clock on phone to help with my marijuana addiction too, but I always blow it off and smoke anyways. Since last June, I\u2019ve probably smoked 95% of the days away. On the bright side even though I\u2019m a wreck, I\u2019ve held my job for three years and have gotten good grades. Yet I don\u2019t care about either of those things. I want to live an authentic lifestyle. What makes me happy. Still though the only reason I\u2019m still breathing is because I\u2019m clinging to hope. What happens when that goes away? I\u2019ve been working on myself a lot lately. I\u2019ve gained about 10 lbs and have been working out, and my acne/scarring is slowly improving. I resent this though because I feel at a standstill. I want someone to love, and friends to stick by me. I want to be a normal college student. I made a Tinder, and that was both good and bad. I bought gold so I could see who swiped right on me, and to my surprise there are actually cute, interesting people that have expressed interest in me. However, I\u2019m so disgusted with myself that I refuse to acknowledge them, telling myself that I\u2019m going to improve so much this summer and that it\u2019d be better to initiate contact later. Plus I\u2019ve got serious trust issues after my first true relationship ended with me being cheated on for quite awhile. Should probably get all this in check first. I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I am constantly thinking about dying. I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m in immediate danger, but if summer passes and I am in the same situation, there is no other viable option because I will not continue on like this.",

For years I've been sharing my brain space with various individuals, most of them I'd known since I was a teen. I spent my twenties assuming I was insane, because obviously it all had to be a figment of my imagination. It turned out it wasn't.\n\nAs I finally broke away from them, I found myself caught up in something else. It was the people I lived with, and their friends, and they pulled my mind apart over and over again for years until they had themselves and other people convinced this was the way I should live. My face and body are covered in marks from self-harm - too many times people knew what they were doing, laughed, continued, and I had no way to distract myself from the horrors they had swarming around my head except to cut at my own skin. Half of the time it's impossible to even get outside, to get into the city centre, or shop, or speak to someone, or perform most of the normal tasks of a functional human being. I forget what I'm doing - people are pulling the memories from my mind, they push their own thoughts and feelings into holes created by vicious trauma they've helped cover up. It's a constant nightmare, and it doesn't matter what I do, or how many times or in how many different ways I ask people to leave me alone, or try to explain they're wrong to play along with what was done to me, there are hundreds of people in this city that have knowingly and enthusiastically decided to torture my mind. Others have tried to help, one way or another.\n\nIt's become a game. Something people compete in, and through. And every second of it I feel torn apart - pulled in multiple directions at once - sick and dizzy and terrified. Not alone, never alone, never at peace, day and night stuck suffocating on other peoples mental shit.\n\nI have a flat of belongings to organize, so the job doesn't fall to someone else once I'm gone, a package to send, a phone call to make, then I'm done.\n\nI've told the professionals working with me, but then I've told them I wasn't ok with this bullshit for years and they haven't listened, so I'm not really worried about them interfering.\n\nGod bless and good luck to anyone reading this, I hope you find a way to help build a better world than the one we live in.\n\nDo no harm \nBear no ill will \nTell no lie \nBelieve no lie \nAccept no falsehood \nMake no compromise\n\nDo good, be good, do better",

Childhood wise, I was bullied at school, had an abusive father and a mother who was objectivley abusive but I struggle to call her that because she tried. \n\nI've tried to do what you are supposed to do. I've sought help, I've started going to a psychiatrist but it's taking a while for the appointments to be consistent because it's free and therefore busy. I struggle to believe treatment is going to work honestly. I really want to try anti depressants but I already feel numb, that's kind of the problem. I feel like I've been clinically depressed for an overwhelming majority of my life, I feel like this is just what I am. \n\nI'm struggling to function at all. Showering is hard, putting clothes on when I'm home alone is hard, forget doing something constructive like going to the gym - basics are too hard let alone life changers. I feel like this incredible burden on my family who have to support me and obviously don't want to anymore. Last year I was enthused by my new studies but this year the sheen has worn off and I'm bored and exhausted and couldn't care less. \n\nI feel like the first 18 years of my life were such a constant cocophany of abusive words or behaviour that I'm just this broken shell of a person and I just. can't. function. I don't know how to fix it. I don't know how I'm ever going to feel calm or not anxious or energetic, let alone happy. \n\nI feel like with my birthday tomorrow, it's for some reason made me feel like this is all inescapable. The number feels significant, like being my previous age it was acceptable to be a piece of shit who can barely hold a job or look after themselves and who is constantly depressed, but with this new number it just feels so pathetic. Like its gone from 'my childhood has been bad it's ok' to 'your life is simply just bad and you just suck'. I feel like I need to go away somewhere and somehow entirely rebuild myself but I don't know how or where and not to mention money. \n\nI just want it to stop. I just want to feel ok, not even happy just ok to be here. I just want to stop feeling anxious all of the fucking time. I want to be able to live a normal life and be ok in that life and not constantly feeling like I'm just holding it together. I want the energy to do actual things and have an actual life. \n\nI can't see how that's going to happen. I can't see when that's going to happen. Every day all I look forward to is going back to bed and every time I wake up I wish I hadn't. ",

I am emotionally dying inside. \n\nCurrently I am very ill. I seem to have caught the flu, but it's the worst I've ever experienced. I started going deaf, temporarily blind, and fainted earlier. His reaction was to scream at me for \"being ridiculous\". When I asked him to please stop yelling at me and that I think I need to go to the ER he told me I'm being a little bitch and that this is normal. He told me something is seriously mentally wrong with me and that I did this to hurt him. \n\nI'm honestly worried from what I've googled that fainting like that is truly a bad sign. I feel very weak and bad. I am scared and very hurt. I don't want to die. I cannot afford medical attention easily and he will possibly attack me if I call for help. \n\nHow do I emotionally feel better? Is this a death sentence?

For the past 6 to 9 months I have been doing therapy, trying to figure out if there is a little chance of not hating everything and measures escalating in ending my own fucking life, but I guess there wasn't such a thing. Did that shitty \"therapy\" help me? No, it fucking didn't it and just made even more hopeless, miserable, let down. Now I am abusing all kinds of medications, faking prescriptions just to get myself the needed medications. Every day I ask myself If I am really worth it? Do I deserve all these people, who are next to me, when I need them, a lover and a chance to study abroad, to study what I have ever dreamt of? Even before doing drugs and abusing medications, I was still miserable and suicidal, but now I depend on these useless medications, to which I have build a tolerance. \n\nEven my suicidal attempts have been a failure: a huge amount of zopiclone and zolpidem (belbien tabs, 10mg; zopilcone, 7.5mg tabs), tramadol hydrochloride (tramadol tabs, 300mg), every other fucking benzodiazepine, oxycodone (roxys tabs, 40mg and 80mg) and a lot more, but it doesn't even matter, when they don't even work. ;[\n\nIs it really worth it, fellas?

I guess I told my brother-in-law to just let me go while he was pressing on my wound to keep me alive. A lot of times I wish I would have died. I'm sober now and I still want to die. I have been trying to be a better person and save up money to move out of my parents house. They told me they want me out by July. I desperately want to move out, but I don't have any savings. My mom told me that she feels like her happiness is wrapped up in me. I told her that's a terrible place for it. I had an interview for an apprenticeship that would be good to get me some financial stability. I spent the night with a girl and went on a date with her. There are good things going on in my life and people say they like spending time with me and sometimes I believe them. I still imagine killing myself most every night. I figure I'll probably do it if this apprenticeship thing doesn't pan out, which is likely. I don't talk about this with anyone in my life. I have an appointment with an addiction medicine counselor next week, we'll see if it helps. Thanks for letting me vent.",

I was able to leave school and pursue my dream of working on cars for a living. I also worked my way up for it since year 8 including a Pre trade course, working on my own vehicles at home and a few other things. I was getting majorly socially isolated and bullied. the apprenticeship felt like a dream come true. (which it was for me at the time.)\n\nskip around after 10 weeks of working. i get told that the company was too ambitious to hire a apprentice and that they had to let me go (not due to my performance or anything.) \n\nI was outright devastated, I lost my place in my dream industry. I was told that I had 4 weeks to get a new apprenticeship or I have to go back to school (and catch up 1st term) or find secondary education \n\nIts now currently week 2, my motorbike needs attention and I don't have the funds to maintain my pride and joy anymore. my phone got broken and I found out my mother had a heart attack with all this crap going on trying to look for a new job. I honestly see no point... I feel like I'm going to fail at getting a new apprenticeship and have to deal with the bullying and isolation from school on top of trying to complete 10 weeks worth of work including the current. \n\nI feel like I should at least seek some help from others and see if i still feel the same way. I doubt my feelings will change although. i have been on and off with my thoughts since year 7 and i think this is where i break.\n\nif you are reading this, thank you for reading my rant, I doubt many people will give a shit enough to read this.\n",

I tried so hard to make myself look nice for girls, but they treated me like I was some kind of creep and made me feel worthless.

Everyone always talked about looking for girlfriends/boyfriends, and didn't even consider me. Hardly anyone ever did.\n\nI've since dropped out of school. I sleep my days away.

            "selftext": "hi all, throwaway acc for reasons, anyway long time sub first time poster. Was hoping I would never want to post here but for the last few years i've slowly feel like i'm becoming less and less happy. I really am unsure if I am unhappy or if i'm just a lazy prick but either way I wish I had someone to talk to about these feeling I have. I haven't really thought much of the future because I just go with the flow. it's my first year in college and i really enjoy it significantly more than high school due to all the phony idiots. I have had the most beautiful and privileged life and i feel so rotten and selfish for thinking such awful thoughts. I hate being patronized so I never vent my feelings to anyone but I feel like it's got to a point where I want to tell someone just in case I do feel too low one night and make a poor choice. I never speak my feeling to my friends because I have built such a solid reputation for myself and it would be a shame to tarnish it. I am nearly 19 years old and i have had a document since 2014 that I just write my thoughts in. I never intend on showing anybody the document because it has my true feelings in it and my image would be completely changed if someone had seen it. It may seem laughable but i've had a resolve for a while now to try and perish by my mid 20's. I don't think that i am sad, instead i believed i'm just not interested in living. I never talk about these things because they cause unnecessary problems for my friends and family and I don't want to do that to them . I find it much easier to keep my thoughts in my head and avoid venting. I recently met this wonderful girl and she treats me so well for no reason. I know I don't deserve her yet she sees something in me that I can't. I have never felt this way about somebody before and i'm almost certain that i'm in love with her. She makes it seem like all my issues are so insignificant and I am unbelievably happy every time we're together, her lips are so soft and her eyes are so beautiful. She makes me extremely happy and it has been a  self proclaimed duty of mine to keep her smiling. She has a hard time in her home because she moves around so much and her father is a dick. This summer she is moving across the country and she is heartbroken because her and I have built such a strong relationship and we connect with one another so fluently. She insists on a long distance relationship, but she is so beautiful that I have no concern that she would be able to easily replace me. I love her and only want her to be happy but she's so hinged on me that it hurts her to think about moving. I lie in bed at night and think about her moving and it feels like heart is being squeezed and crushed yet I can't show and emotion. I don't know when I became this empty and cold. When she moves I don't  know what i am going to do. I frequently have suicidal thoughts and I have been getting less and less sleep and getting sick easier. I was hoping I could receive some advice that might help me because I really can't see myself looking so far into the future. As I write this I have a straight face and lump in my throat yet i can't cry or show emotion. I wish I was just doing this for attention but I can't say I am. Sometimes I see other people posting their problems and wonder if they really do feel that way or they are just fishing for attention. I just want all my loved ones to be happy but I don't think that's something I can offer them. I am a very comedic and outgoing person, but in reality I feel morbid and lonely. Sorry for taking up your time but I do appreciate you reading this though I probably missed some stuff. Be well all",

It's the perfect time.\n\nExcept i don't want my dad to have to deal with my dead body. It'd be a pain cleaning up my piss and shit and he deserves better than that. My therapist gave me a list of crisis lines, and i'm tempted to call, except now is literally the *perfect* time.\n\nI'm torn. I don't want my dad to be forced to do extra work in taking care of my corpse but the desire is there. It's strong. Tylenol itself only causes fatalities due to organ damage and failure, i won't die quick. But i'd still end up dead.\n\nIf i do go through with it, and end up surviving, i'm gonna suggest going to a psych ward. I've been to one before and lied my way out but my dad shouldn't deal with my bullshit. He's mentioned that i'm causing him stress. I'm a worthless kid. I'm a danger to myself at this point so getting sent to a psych ward would most likely be for the best, right?\n\nI'm conflicted and i hate this.",

            "selftext": "It is 00:33 and there is no one around.  The few people I speak with, are long asleep, or with loved ones or their friends.  And I am alone, as I have been, for many years.\n\nI never thought I would get to this point.  I thought it would be some emotional outbreak where everything overwhelmed me, and I would want an exit.  I thought it would be a violent emotional, regretful thing I would think or say.  I never thought it would be quiet resignation.  I never would imagine that it would feel like accepting that you would never be with the person you expected to be with.\n\nI was a happy young girl, once.  I had a lot of dreams.  I didn't have the best of friends.  In fact, many of them always had someone they preferred over me.  I was always everyone's second choice.  For a little while I was upset about that.  Over time, I only grew to accept it.\n\nMy family scattered when I was 17, when my mother died.  Life wasn't really good as a teenager.  Her sickness made my family stressed out, and her subsequent death drove my father to solitude and detachment, and my brother, to drugs.  My last real Christmas was when I was 16.  I am now 31.\n\nI made a few friends through my life but many fell through.  Many of them seemed false, or perhaps, my inherent issues drove them away.  I wish I could say.  I don't even have many online friends.  I spend time on Twitter, desperately trying to connect with people about my hobbies.  Instead, I find myself slowly finding less and fewer things to say.  I see others make connections and I remain, just as I was as a child, on the fringes.  \n\nThere was a time in my mid-20s I was a vivacious, funny, young woman.  After my mom's death, I had made myself determined to build my life by the time I was 30 and never have to endure these lonely nights again.  I worked rough jobs, lived in rough places, gave where I could and always tried to have a smile on my face.  It didn't really get me anywhere.  The people I wished to be friends with, once again, preferred others to me.  My love life stopped when I was 27.  I fell in love with a person whom I now know was going through his own deep seated and toxic issues.  Those issues ended up damaging me even further.  \n\nHe really was the only kind of happiness I had ever known.  So I went after him, by trying so hard to keep up with his creativity, his ambition, his intelligence.  I failed that, as I failed absolutely everything.\n\nI lost my job 4 months ago.  Nothing due to my fault - it was a layoff, from a startup that had hired on an unscrupulous employee, and appointed him in a very dangerously authoritative position.  He has since wiped out my software engineering team since my departure.  Some say it would be karma; however, karma has not even delivered me a simple helpdesk job offer.\n\nI realized I don't want to live anymore.  The past decade has been one survival scraping away after the other.  I kept thinking I was paying my dues for a better future; a future where I could have those love-filled holidays, friendships that I could enjoy and enrich my life, even find love, again.  I worked absolutely hard and put everything I had for years.  Nothing panned out.  Nothing worked.  Each and every time I felt I was getting somewhere, it all fell apart.\n\nNow everything is getting older.  Opportunities are closing.  Life is becoming different in a way that I don't know if I have the money, the mental stability, or the energy to continue further.  I reached out to my father, pleading for me to come home because I am finding days I do not eat - sometimes two days at a time - and I have lost 20lbs in 2 months.  I was not overweight - I was simply 150lbs, and now 130, and still losing.  He's told me he is going on another business trip, and we just \"simply needed the money for things\".  I have been waiting for him to come home for the past 4 months.    I told him I was thinking of killing myself.  He thought I was being overdramatic.  I pleaded and started to cry.  He said that life is tough and sometimes that's all life is - just scraping to survive.  Asking for help from him only made me feel like I was a petulant child, so I simply remained quiet, until we parted amicably on the phone.\n\nI've started to look up lawyers about writing a will.  I will only delegate whatever belongings I have to an old friend who lives far from me, and the rest to charity or my father.  I don't have many people to give the things I have once I am gone.\n\nI wanted a wonderful life, and I tried very hard for it.  I understand now, after so many repeated failures, and clear abandonment from everyone possible in my life, in nearly every turn, I don't believe I ever will.  I truly do not believe I will ever be happy.  I am only here as a last stop and means of keeping myself from going.  I don't even recognize who I am anymore.",

I am extremely worthless. \n\nI am Chinese, born in Brazil. I speak  a little Portuguese and Spanish, however, I do not speak any Chinese at all. My parents never taught me at all, and I was too dumb to learn it in school.\n  \nI only know English fluently, however, I speak it with such a heavy accent and have severe social anxiety so my words do not flow and are shaky whenever I talk to any one I might be nervous with. \n\nI am in community college because my high school grades were too shitty and I never bothered to apply to any colleges. I am trying to transfer as a computer science major but am failing Pre-Calculus. Before this, I was failing intermediate algebra TWICE. I really want to transfer as a computer science major, but I do not think I am smart enough to do so. \n\nI have bounced from jobs repeatedly because I cannot keep one. I started off my first job as a restaurant host, then continued working at other restaurants. Got fired from two, was put on warning in two others. I decided to try another field of work, so I became an office assistance for All-State the insurance company. Was told that I need to speak more and ask for help, and be more proactive rather than just file papers. \n\nI am not even good in video games. I suck at every game I have played, and the ones I dedicate the most time to, I only end up being above average. \n\nI have severe social anxiety, I feel that my brain does not function to its capability. I literally FEEL dumb. I feel myself being dumb, I have terrible memory and I do not converse very well. My entire life I have been told I am quiet. \"She's so quiet\" \"Why are you so quiet?\" \n\nI have depression as well. It is just so extremely difficult for me to get out of bed and do anything. If i had the option to, I choose to sleep in bed all day. in fact, even when I do not have the option to, I still decide to sleep in bed all day and end up missing class.\n\nhonestly, I just wish I never existed. Nothing would change any way. I do not contribute anything to anyone. I am dumb and incompetent. ",

            "selftext": "When I was 15 I was horribly depressed. The only thing that stopped me from killing myself is talking myself into believing that because I was 15 I hadn't even given life a chance. I wasn't allowed to kill myself until I was 25. That would give me 10 years to figure out if life really was worth living or if I should just end it. This is the only way I talked myself out of killing myself, and it actually helped me force myself to get help when I kept trying to push the date closer and closer to my age at the time and I realized I really needed help or I would kill myself in a month.\n\nThe problem is now I'm 22. 7 years have passed and I have nothing to show for it. I'm an absolute fuck up and worse than where I started. I blew all my college money failing and dropping out and then reapplying etc etc. I have no friends I can see in person on a regular basis that I actually like or look forward to. I don't trust my actual friends much with telling them my actual emotions and shit because I don't want to be a joke or someone pitied. I had to move back in with my parents after my first major college fuck up and I've been here longer than I can stand and I feel pathetic. I have no money saved up and my parent's constant financial issues of their own cause me massive guilt. I got a job recently where I make decent money, but it's dull work and a soulless office job, but I guess that's okay because it's not like I have any passion or desire to do anything in life anyways. I'm also horribly obese and ugly, and the only relationship I've ever been in is when I was 16 and emotionally manipulated by an older man online. I've really tried to put myself out there and find hobbies, but nothing is that interesting. I play dnd with friends and video games on my own, but even these things aren't that great.\n\nI'm ranting, but I guess what I'm getting at is I'm just in disbelief at how close I finally am to the date I set. I'm less than 3 Years to 25. My life has gone downhill since I was 15, and my time to become happy is coming to an end. At least the date has a calming effect. There's something comforting to be able to go \"fuck it I'm going to kill myself in x years anyways\".",

            "selftext": "So.. I don\u2019t know where to begin but I will try to keep this as short as possible. Please bare with me as I have barely talked about my experience even to the mother of my child.. For aslong as I remember I was abused physically and mentally  by my father, at a young age he would beat me without holding back as if I were a man, he\u2019s ex military with combat training, he was big and and powerful. At a young age he would beat my mother and do crazy things, he\u2019s tried to kill himself numerous times throughtout my life and only 4 years ago he succeeded, but the damage he has done to me has ruined my chance for a happy life. He would be triggered by everything and anything big or small, everyday I would get a beating or two, he was a ticking timebomb. I had nobody to run to, my mum left him since I was a kid and would hardly visit me because she\u2019s terrified of him and my family were too far away, If my mother didn\u2019t visit or listen to him I would suffer the consequences. He has nearly killed me a few times that\u2019s just how badly he would beat me. I didn\u2019t realise I was being abused until when I turned 15 and my first girlfriend left me and I went home crying, all I wanted was to hug my father. As I entered he said why are you crying? And so I explained, he got up from his chair and walked towards me, before I knew it I was dazed and my ears were ringing I had no idea what hit me until he threw me agains\u2019t the wall and beat me like a man. His punches were so fast and powerful I had no chance to defend my face or body, that moment I realised my father doesn\u2019t love me. I was always so terrefied to go home after school, I would find any reason to stay in school a little longer.. when I was in college my father decided to take his life again but succeeded this time. I remember the moment I got a phone call by the police and my heart sunk, I weeped like a baby and my heart broke. After his death I spent my life as a zombie, I don\u2019t even remember the 2 years of my life after his death. I was just so depressed and exhausted I felt empty. Until I met the mother of my child, she saved me, she gave me a will to live as she made me feel like I\u2019m worth something. I tried my best to change and accept life, be happy. She gave birth to my son, I have never been so happy and satisfied with my life until after 3 years of being together my past came back to haunt me and I suffered from anxiety and depression, I couldn\u2019t stay happy no matter what I did. I know I put her through hell with the way I was acting but I couldn\u2019t help it. My mother who got in contact with her briefed her of my childhood but she failed to understand me.. I felt so hopeless and I was bringing everyone I loved and cared about down with me. The other day we got into a huge arguement and before this arguement a few days earlier I lost a friend of mine due to an accident and was feeling down so I wasn\u2019t feeling 100%, the arguement continued and something she said triggered me and I ended up being rough to her, I grabbed her throat and tried to choke her and put her against the wall. I quickly realised what I was doing and snapped out of it before it got worse, she was in shock and crying, I felt at the moment as if I died, I looked at my hands and couldn\u2019t believe what I have done. Whoever that was it wasn\u2019t me, I tried to calm her down and comfort her but I understand she was so terrified, the look she had cut my soul like a knife.. today she has left with my son. Maybe she will forgive me and return but I will never forgive myself for this. I have turned into someone who I didn\u2019t want to be and I am now thinking will I continue to turn into my father? I stooped to his level. I will not allow myself to hurt her ever again or maybe my son in the future. They have been the best thing that\u2019s every happened to me, but I\u2019m ready to go, I\u2019m just so exhausted, I spent my whole life in a dark lonely place and when I found light to my life I go and hurt them. I hate myself. I just hope my son will forgive me when he grows up. I\u2019m just too exhausted to carry on.. I know this has been long and I missed out on alot so the story may be choppy, but if you read it this far thank you, I just needed to take something off my chest for a long time..",

So I sat there for ages just thinking about it and I really wanted to, so so bad.\n\nI started crying and the urge grew stronger but I couldn\u2019t decide if I wanted to. I started crying more and more and louder and louder and my dog came to the bathroom door and was whining and scratching the door. It sounded like he was crying with me and it broke my heart. Then my partner heard and came to see what was wrong. He started getting really worried and came in to see me crying.\n\nI couldn\u2019t do it to my love or my puppy. My partner helped me out of the bath, wrapped me up and comforted me. I couldn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t but I still don\u2019t know how to feel about what happened.\n\nMy dog saved me. ",

            "selftext": "I don't want to post my entire life's story. Long story short, I turned 28 a few months ago. My &lt;18 school life was awful- constant bullying, body image issues (was overweight and on Imipramine to help w/ depression). I decided to join the military and because I was really smart I got put in a program that required the best and brightest. Nuclear Power. It was 4 years of torture. I got off my meds that I had been on my entire life to join in hopes that the benefits and money would outweigh any potential negatives (with consultation from my doctors, who said I could try to get off). Boy was I wrong. I had people on my ship that *made it their goal* to make me kill myself. They told me as much to my face. 4 years of mental torture, lack of sleep (&lt;4 hours a night while underway) and I couldn't take it anymore. I had a total mental breakdown and did whatever I had to do to get out short of offing myself. And I got out- with no benefits. No money in the bank because I was frivolosuly spending everything trying to fill the hole in my life and be happy. I started working for my dad, who owned his own restaurant. I was hoping to help him into retirement, maybe take over the business- but he was forced out of the location he was in and didn't have the money, time, or strength to move the restaurant for a 5th time. So he closed his doors, very suddenly putting me out of a job. 2 months I scrambled to find something, ANYTHING i enjoyed that could keep me interested enough to come to work on time, and be happy with what I do. I found something like that, working as a car mechanic. But the pay was awful, because they were the only ones in town who hired people with 0 experience in a shop. Minimum wage *or* 13% commission, whichever was higher. Commission checks only came out to around $800-900. Barely enough to scrape by, working 70+ hours a week. But I liked what I did. Then, a couple of weeks ago, just as I figured my life was getting on track, right at the VERY DAY that I was thinking to myself \"things aren't so bad, I just need a few more months experience and I can move up to a new shop and get paid more\" I got into a car accident, breaking my pelvis and rendering myself unable to work. It happened on the job, so I *should* get workers compensation, but it hasn't come yet. Insurance tells me I'm 100% at fault, and my dream car that I spent YEARS working on is gone. \n\nI'm at the end of my rope. I have no money, can't work, no car, my relationship with my S/O is extremely strained because of the money situation. I have nothing to look forward to on any given day. I think about suicide constantly. I don't want to do it because I don't want to hurt my family and my S/O, but I just can't take the mental pain anymore. I don't know what to do. I find myself staring at the implements that I could perform the act with, self-conflicted as to whether I've finally had enough. Whether it's worth ending my pain and trading that off to the few people I know. I can't stand it. I've asked for help from every government organization, charity, and person that I can think of for my situation and nothing has come. I've been living off of loans because I literally have no way to eat or pay my rent otherwise.  My entire life has been nothing but pain and suffering from my own mind by the hands of a few cruel people and bad luck. I don't know where to turn. I don't have any options left. I can't move, can't get a raise, can't get any money from anywhere to change my situation. I can't work or work harder to make more money. I'm completely helpless and don't have anywhere else to turn. I tried the suicide hotline chat and it wasn't very helpful tbh. I was referred to the food stamp program and asked a handful of questions that made me feel like I was being pitiful for thinking that my situation was so bad. Obviously others around the world have it worse, but when my life has been one CONSTANT downward spiral, I can't help but feel empty and full of fear when I hit what I think is rock bottom and it *just keeps going*. \n\nThrowaway for obvious reasons... sorry for the awful formatting, I just have to get all of this out. I have nobody to talk to. I'm afraid if people I know knew how on the fence I am about doing it things wouldn't turn out well at all. I don't know if the hospital I went to for my broken hip has a mental health person but I don't know if I should talk to them either as they could have me committed 'for my own safety' which is the last thing I want. I've heard so many horror stories about it that it would be the last straw for me if that happened. ",

            "selftext": "I'm a 19 year old kid living on his own, attending college 3 hours away from home. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD due to my upbringing under an alcoholic father and complacent mother. I'm so desperately trying everything to survive being an adult on my own, but whether it be money, or school or even friendships I'm a fuck up. I'm trying to land a fulltime job in this new city, I'm trying to eat healthier and lose weight, I'm trying to attend all of my classes and get the grades I need all the while keeping in touch with my family and friends. My folks are always on my case about when I'm seeing them next, but I cant just up and drive three hours when I work two part time jobs and have school. They say I'm inconsiderate, and try to guilt me into going home when that atmosphere is toxic for me. My father, who is playing the loving act after so many years just wont leave me alone. After abusing me and my mother up until I moved out, he calls me all the time letting me know he misses me. But that is mute at this point. I want to forgive him, but I just can't shake the destruction he's done to my confidence, my mental health. I don't even know what it means to be a man. Nothing I do, whether it be going to school, working my ass or being social is ever enough. If I just ended it then I would have no more expectations to meet, it would be my choice and that would feel truly liberating. But I'm conflicted, because I want a future. I enjoy life when its good. However I keep letting everyone down, even myself. I feel like so many dislike me or think I'm weird. I have zero self confidence, I hate who I am. I'm always jumping to help others, but nobody ever checks in me, no one asks if I'm okay. I am so alone, I feel like I'm suffocating. (I know this is somewhat of a repost from earlier this week, but I would love some other insight or just someone to talk to about this.) ",

I sincerely feel like there is no solution to my mindset, I am extremely self aware and think about how much I hate my life every single day. Even in moments where things should be \"happy\" I can feel how fake it is and am aware of the depression lingering inside, no one in my life knows I feel this way and I'm just tired of it all.

For the ast 8 years i had to spend most of my free time driving my grandparents back and forth to either chemo or doctors appointments that are a about a 3 hour round trip. My grandpa was the only person holding us together as a family he passed 3 years ago.Just recently i had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital with my grandma and as a stroke survivor almost drove me crazy hearing the same thing over and over. Yesterday was my birthday made plans with friends and they all flaked as usual, had to remind family it was my birthday , my own mother didn't even tell me happy birthday. Only reason im still here is because of my dog i would have ended it sooner but conversations with my dog while high are amazing. At this point im thinking my best option is killing him and myself or killing him and doing suicide by cop.",

            "selftext": "(old account I used just to follow this subreddit)\n\nI think I just tried to kill myself.\nAnd it didn't work.\nAnd I'm not sure where to go from here.\nI don't really feel anything, and that was the issue in the first place.\n\nI went to school and I decided I just couldn't see anyone today so I skipped most of my hours. I just sat down in the computer lab attached to the counseling office for 3 hours. And I started writing stuff down and trying to process everything. I'd been feeling like shit. I've been feeling like shit for a while. It's not like suicidal ideation was new. It's an obsession. An honest obsession. I have obsessive compulsive disorder and my therapist agrees that this is just an obsessive thought pattern.\n\n1.) I am a bad person. I may not have \"done anything wrong\" to deserve to die, but I've never done anything good to deserve to live.\n\n2.) I need to hurt myself in order to make up for my actions. As in, saying some embarrassing, taking up someones time, taking up space, making a mistake, asking for things. Usually, after cutting or hitting or burning myself, the compulsion is finished and I stop worrying about whether or not I'm a bad person.\nI've suffered, I'm physically hurt, I've made up for everything.\n\n3.) If that's not enough, and it never is, the compulsion to do something worse rolls in. I figure I'll either end up actually dying, or I'll survive the attempt. I'll survive and I'll wake up in a hospital and it'll be like my brain reset itself and suddenly I'm able to form relationships and interact with people and create things and get out of my own head and just be a normal person and everything will just suddenly be better. Because I wasn't willing to just hurt myself to make up for being a bad person. I was willing to die and I would be rewarded with a second chance.\n\nThe few times I've made or really attempted to make a real plan something intervenes. \nThere end up being no pills (other than a handful of ibuprofen) in my house since my dads anti medication.\nA train stops all traffic from coming down the street I walked to for 20 minutes, and then I get a call, by the time the cars start coming I'm talked into walking back home.\nI'm considering just walking in front of a car when it turns out to be my dads car and he leans on the horn. Snaps me out of it.\n\nAnd now I broke the curtain rod.\nThe closets in my house are weird. Theres no rod to hang clothes on, they all have shelves with hooks.\nThe shower curtain rod is flimsy.\nThe only thing in my house that looked sturdy enough was the curtain rod in the family room. Which is more just a junk room.\nAnd when I got home I decided to start calling people. I decided a letter was a bad idea. I had made a list of the people I'd call, thought over what I was gonna say and just. Nothing came out. \nI called the person I was the least close with first. I figured I'd call and try to honestly tell him I appreciated him and that I loved him and I sat there silently for about 30 seconds when he picked up. We ended up talking about a video game.\nAt this point I had been sitting in the family room. I was messing around with the rope, tying and untying and retying a noose and messing with the curtain rod to see what part was the sturdiest and just tugging on it and the rope and just sat on the phone and let him talk.\nAnother friend called. I tried to tell her the same thing I tried to tell him. Just sat there silently for the most part and let her talk about the book she was reading and her college plans.\nSame thing. Just. Fucked around with the rope. And I stood there for a while and when she hung up I looked at my contacts list and I couldn't call the other people. I couldn't get myself to. \nI realized I got the knot right and it freaked me out I think. The fact that yeah, that'd work. That'd do it. And I took the rope down and I just sat in bed and I didn't do anything. Fell asleep for a bit and then sat in bed for a few more hours just. Not doing anything. \nI woke up feeling so much worse and I went right back downstairs and I did it again and I called my friend who was practically my sister and again I just couldn't fucking speak. I had been crying so when she picked up I put myself on mute and kept crying trying to calm myself down.  Let her talk about her boyfriend. She asked if something was wrong and I said no. She tried to make a joke about how upset I sounded. I tried to make a joke and just changed the subject back to her boyfriend. When I hung up I tried to tell her I loved her and I couldn't do it. \nI think it's because if I tried to say something like that, to anyone, they would have known what was up.\nCalled my boyfriend. Told him happy birthday at midnight. Just. Held the rope in my hands. Call dropped I think.\nI'd talked to enough people on my list and I looked up at the curtain rod and I looked back at the chair and I thought I can just back out of this if I want to. I can kick around and prop myself back up on part of the chair. I can shove my fingers between the rope and my neck. I can find a way to get out of it if after a few seconds I just change my mind.\nAnd the first time, the rope slipped and nothing happened. I think it happened a few times and at this point I was just angry and crying and I don't know what I was even thinking and i just kept trying and trying and thought after a minute if I'm not meant to do it, the rod would just break. And I kind of prayed to just. Anything, because I wanted this to work, I wanted to either die or have some miracle happen that would instantly make me a person who deserved to live and deserved all the love around me and I thought it's just not gonna work and I did it again and the thing holding the curtain rod snapped off the wall and I fell and I looked back up and the curtain rod was actually in two pieces. It was split at the middle, like that's just how it was made.\nWhy the hell would they design it to not be one piece.\nAnd I just. Sat there. And I wasn't even crying I just didn't feel anything.\nI think it's been a little over an hour.\nI don't feel anything. I feel like tomorrows not gonna happen. \nI can't call anybody.\nI just have a headache, honestly.\nI don't think I'm gonna actually tell anyone about this. It's just embarrassing now. I just needed to write this out and process it I guess.\n",

I\u2019m 19 now and can probably buy one but I don\u2019t have the money and I might mess up becoming a cripple the rest of my life. \n\nMy mom recently had a baby that I watch (for now at least) and I have a boyfriend I plan on moving in with soon. I\u2019m almost back to being non-functioning depressed and it\u2019s getting me In trouble (like it always has.) I\u2019ve told my mom about it and she thinks it\u2019s because I don\u2019t go outside/socialize. She doesn\u2019t understand how I feel or why no matter how many times I try to describe it. \n\nI have no future and know I won\u2019t amount to anything but I feel like it\u2019s too late to kill myself. I want to so badly though. I just want things to end, to be put into the void of nothingness, where I\u2019m alone/nonexistent and everything is just over. I\u2019ve already disappointed everyone so much as well. But I\u2019m too heavily incorporated into my boyfriends life and I now have too many \u201cimmediate family members\u201d it might scar(moms boyfriends 10 year old son who\u2019s mom just killed herself, my 2 month old half brother, and my mom). \n\nI\u2019ve had a good life but shit just always happens. Nothing ever goes as planned. And when I get depressed I don\u2019t wanna do anything and I give up on all plans I have. \n\nIt got so bad at one point where the first and only thing I could think of all day was wanting to kill myself (almost ran away into the forest so wild animals could kill me or I would be \u201caccidentally\u201d killed by a hunter), at that time I could only talk to my bf a couple hours a night because I had no cell service/internet at the house and had to go up to the \u201coffice\u201d to use the internet (I was also doing online school which I dropped out of because I just didn\u2019t care anymore.) \n\nI feel like I\u2019m lost and stuck. Im at a point where I just don\u2019t wanna continue living but I feel like I\u2019m forced to. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore and I\u2019m at my wits end. What do I do? Do I just go ahead and get it over with? I love my boyfriend and I don\u2019t want him to be upset and stuff. ",

Here are some of the reasons why I want to die: I\u2019m not smart and I\u2019m not doing that great in school even though I study so hard. I\u2019m insecure about the way I look. I don\u2019t have any real friends. I keep embarrassing myself constantly. No one cares about me and I feel so unwanted. My parents prefer my brother over me because he\u2019s smarter and better looking. My \u201cfriends\u201d keep treating me like shit and I have to stay with them or else I will be completely alone. I\u2019m not very good at making friends I feel like people don\u2019t want to be associated with me. I have gotten bullied a couple of times and I can\u2019t stop overthinking about all the things that hurt me in the past. I don\u2019t know what I want to do in life. I hate feeling this way and I just want everything to end. I know a lot of people have it worse than me but it\u2019s just too hard for me to handle. I tried to kill myself a couple of times but I wasn\u2019t able to. I had hope that things may be better but it\u2019s judging getting worse and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. ",

            "selftext": "I've been suicidal for as long as my memory can go. No matter where I look in my life, I just feel pain, suffering, and anguish. My childhood can be summed up as follows: I grew up in a hardcore christian zealot household. They didn't believe in medicating so when I was diagnosed with ADHD, they wrote it off as lazy. I also suffer from dyslexia to a lesser extent but nobody picked up on until after i flunked out of college. I also grew up with gender dysphoria and am stuck half way through my transition poor, in debt, and working minimum wage with gov health insurance that is just as bad as snail mail.\n\nI had to endure things like having my fourth grade teacher ask my parents to bring a cardboard refrigerator box to put me in during class as to not disturb the other students. I owe the department of education money because I couldn't understand the legal agreement on the Pell Grant and some screw up financial aid lady at the college assured me that I wouldn't have to pay it back, even if for some reason I couldn't pass my classes.\n\nThe disabilities department at the college had lost my form so I wasn't able to get any assistance from them because I \"didn't turn it in within the deadline\". And to add insult to injury, my health insurance stopped covering the ADHD medication shortly into college thus causing me to struggle until I was academically dismissed for my grades. I wound up jumping from job to job and fighting my insurance to get that medication back, and see someone for my gender dysphoria which I ended up having to myself not covered by the insurance. They refused all services related to my gender dysphoria and I spent 2 years juggling work and fighting for them to cover anything until I had a mental break and went into the E.R. on a 5150 2 years ago.\n\nThe doctor put me on a mandatory full medical leave as I was not mentally fit to work. My significant other had contacted my employer to notify them that I was going on FMLA and they ended up firing me for \"no call no show\". I wound up having another mental snap and had to be admitted on a 5150. when I got out, I stayed at my boyfriends dads house till I found a job and we found an apartment. We moved into it, both names on the lease and everything. As soon as the first month went by, I started slipping into another depressive episode, he tried cheering me up, coerced me into birthday sex, and then took my portion of the rent for the next month and threw me out. Every attorney I met with said I had no case even though he broke a legal contract. The only person in my life that has any form of importance lives 14,000 miles away, is on disability, and just been told she can't come back to america anymore if she wants to stay qualified for her disability.\n\nI never asked to be born with ADHD, dyslexia, and gender dysphoria. I never would of accepted the financial aid If I knew failing a course would require me to pay it back. I never chose this. I don't see this as a life, I see it as a cruel fucked torture that people say will get better. Every time someone has shown me a light at the end of the tunnel, Its ended in me being worse off. I can't live any longer if whats in front of me is just as bad as my past.",

            "selftext": "I kind of have a weird tradition I've been technically doing for nearly a decade now, though it's also sort of off and on. See, every year after my most recent suicide attempt, I celebrate it's anniversary. Whether it's a treat to myself or, as was with this past Wednesday, spending the day with myself, I look back on the day I last attempted. I refect on the year and whether or not I think it's been worth surviving.\n\nHowever, this past \"anniversary\" was the first one I could actually celebrate in about four years. Since my first one, I've attempted seven times, and four of those have been stopping said celebration for just under half a decade. You'd think I'd have gotten better since it's finally been a year, right?\n\nThere's not that urge to go and jump off something or to slice myself open, but rather a void that's growing inside. Not necessarily something that is sucking me dry, but rather attempting to fill me up with the emptiness. I'm constantly trying to fight this, but I'm thrown a curve ball each time.\n\nThere's nothing I can do, is there? There's no point in celebrating if I keep losing. I'm just hurting so much, and I know I'm too broken to be fixed. If I can't even appreciate the year since my last attempt, what's the point?",

I was the man. I was the one people came to for back up. I was the one who people wanted to party with. All the females wanted some of this.  Now everyone switched up on me, even family.

Then last year knocked me out cold. \n\nA long term job I gave everything to came to an end leaving me with no viable career options. I am one of the #metoo - I was coerced and forced - sexually, mentally, emotionally abused there for several years and finally I couldn't take it anymore. I can't take him to court or go to police. I can't even share this with anyone and have kept it to myself. I can't even seek therapy - there is nothing to do.\n\nTo get back on my feet, I decided to start a business, poured whatever savings I had into it - and someone I trusted to help stole from me, leaving me at the door of bankruptcy with business about to shut down. \n\nI could have dealt with this if I had a partner in personal life, but he left me last year as well. This was a long term relationship that I believed was for keeps - well, the guy decided to hold out for someone better and walked away from me without an explanation. He vanished from my life. I wanted to get married and start a family with him. \n\nIn all of this, I lost valuable years. Now, I am a 40 year old woman, childless, single, broke, and ashamed of my life choices. Money and career can be still be worked out but my personal hell is here to stay. I will not be able to trust any man for a while, cannot put myself out there after all the hurt I have received from a man who was supposed to be with me for life, and most importantly will likely not have my own kids at my stage. This last one is the one that is the worst in all of this.\n\nLittle to no emotional support from family or friends. With one loss after another, life knocked me out. I was never a mean girl, always helped others, and worked hard and never cheated anyone out of anything. Was always there for anyone who needed my help. Was a good employee, a good girlfriend, a good friend. But it was all a one-way street. Now I am crushed in mind and spirit and I see no light at the end of the tunnel. It is not going to get better. I am now considering ending my life.  Life was never a bed of roses, I had to struggle for everything - but this series of trials is too much to bear. I no longer want to try. I simply do not want to live in this kind of world.  ",

Guys have never found me attractive or interesting, so I've given up on relationships.  I have nothing in my life, and at this point I'm tired of trying to do anything about it.  I was actually pricing guns the other day, but I'm such a damn coward I'd be shocked if I ever did it.  I eat like shit and have let my weight go in hopes that I'll just keel over from a heart attack.  I've said for 10 years that if I got cancer or something, I wouldn't do anything about it.  I'm just so tired of trying.  Life is nothing but an unending series of bullshit and I'm beyond over it.",

            "selftext": "Today has been horrible. I'm 70% sure my best friend has been ignoring me because of how clingy I am towards her (I rely on her too much). There's more, but I'm mainly asking how I can stab myself to get as much blood to leave me as possible; I feel like it would make me feel so much better. I'm just waiting for my mother to sleep, so then I can stab myself. The urge is extremely strong right now. I don't really want to die, I just want to see if extreme self-mutilation will cause me to feel better about myself. \n\nSorry if all of this is incoherent, I'm really trying to figure everything out, and why my life has to be so worthless and just... pointless, to say the least. No wonder everybody thinks of me as the least desirable friend. I don't really know what I want anymore. Help? I guess so, but talking will not help I need to do something physically to myself to cause me to feel better. I just want to die, but I don't know if I can do it tonight. \n\nI just feel like I need to vent and stuff, I don't know anymore. The person I felt like I could turn to so I could cry and she'd make me feel better has abandoned me. I cannot accept this fact, I have do do something to myself. \n\nI really want a shotgun, the first thing I would do with it is sit in a corner, aim the gun at my head, and pull the trigger with my toe. \n\nDrugs? I have thought about attempting to get extremely potent sedatives, you know for severe insomnia. ODing sounds peaceful to me. \n\nAll in all, my thoughts of suicide have definitely increased sharply over the past week; most of my recreational time is spent researching suicide methods and lethal doses for common medicines. I just want her to love me and not think of me as some weirdo that seriously needs to be put down. I cannot blame her for thinking of me in this way, but I just wish she didn't. I love her so, so much. It hurts so, so much to find out that she doesn't, nor will she ever, love me in any way. I love her, I love her, I love her. Nobody can make me feel better about this situation. \n\nI am sorry for boring you all with my venting, but I needed to get some things off my chest. I would've talked to her about all this, but she wouldn't care to know. ",

It isn't despair, it's apathy--I would've liked to have lived a good life, but it seems as if it was arrogant of me to pretend I was fit to be part of a society, even with medication. It would be much easier for me to just stop. I don't mean that in a self-pitying way. It just...this isn't working for anybody. Not for me. Not for people who know me. Could feed and medicate me for another 40-70 years but why bother really?\n\nI don't know if I should be more or less concerned by feeling this way. I don't feel desperate or like I'm going to impulsively crash my car or anything (I remember feeling that way and doing that before I was medicated, this isn't like that). I just feel a sort of calm mounting inexorability toward the best-outcome of my death. Sorry. I don't know what I'm driving toward here or what to make of it. Just counting down mainly. ",

She had approached me last week and asked me if she could see a therapist so I of course made her the appointment. Then this happens. Depression runs in my family. My mother and I both have it. Mine much more severe than my moms. I just don't know what to think. I'm not sure what to do. She is with her dad this weekend. I want to speak with her, just me and her, before I tell her father. We are much closer and she is much more open with me than she is with her dad. I don't know if I should pick her up and bring her home for a bit tomorrow and talk to her or if I should wait til she gets home on Monday. I need to keep her away from these other kids, yea? Or would that push her away from me? I'm just so lost. I know the signs. Every day when she gets home from school we cuddle on the couch, talk, play games. We laugh and share jokes, we have shows we watch together. I'm just.. I don't know. I'm sorry, this is probably very discombobulated. My mind is every where right now.

            "selftext": "At the age of 35, it's been about 20 years, my entire adult life, that existence has been a chore and a burden. \n\nI suppose when you're young you always think things will change, you'll \"grow up\" and everything will be different, but honestly I'm done, I'm so exhausted, I've fought the urge to go for as long as I can take and with each day that passes my future gets more and more bleak and my suffering more and more unbearable.\n\nI'm just incapable of being happy, any notions of joy or happiness I've ever experienced are so far outweighed by the constant misery and suffering that I'm just ready. I don't want to continue, I just want to no longer exist.\n\nBut what's kept me here this long is the thoughts of how to kill myself, how to get out. I don't want a particularly violent death, mostly because of the fear of survival, but also for those left behind, I wish I could just go out dignified.\n\nI had to put my dog down a few years ago and as heartbreaking as it is to think about, I'm glad I afforded him some dignity when it was clear that living had become more painful than it was worth for him.\n\nI really wish we afforded each other the same level of dignity and could choose to end our own life and be supported in that decision by giving us an option to say our goodbyes, receive an injection and fall asleep never to awaken.\n\nIronically that dignity is reserved for only the worst in society who receive a death penalty.\n\nCan anyone suggest a peaceful and dignified way to go? Everything is such a risk, the risk of survival is too much and as I say, I don't want an awful, violent end like a gunshot to the head.",

I asked him if he didnt sleep well and he didn't really answer, so i shrugged it off... A few drinks later my friend came to me obviously inebriated, and told me that he was feeling down lately and that he didn't had the energy and motivation to do anything lately. He did a lot of overtime last week because it's the only thing that could distract him and that he always thought of someone. I believe that he meant another girl in our group that turned him down a month ago, but I'm not sure. And then he said that he was thinking about suicide. I didn't really say anything that contributed to our conversation because im afraid ill say something wrong, so i just listened to him. When we got home he texted me that this evening was shit and he shouldn't talk that much. I said that i will always listen but i suggested that it would be better if he sleeps first so he can talk with a sober mind.\n\n\n\n\nSo now i kind of feel like I've been hit by a truck and my heart is pounding... I don't really now what to say, i read the text in r/SWresources but id like a few other tips because im not really good at such serious conversation to begin with .",

            "selftext": "This is my first and maybe my last post on reddit, you can totally ignore this, it is not going to matter, I just want to put some stuff off my chest.\nHere I go, I lived a happy life back in my hometown in Romania, then it all went to sh*t when I moved to the U.K.. I honestly have most of the things a teenager would want (I am 16, sorry if it seems like I am bragging). Got a phone, a PC, everything but my friends.\nI moved here 2 years ago, this summer I went on holiday back to my hometown and I met \"that special person\" again, I felt true happines for that 1 month I was there, I cried of happines everynight knowing that next morning I would wake up and go meet her, actual happines, do you know what that feels like ? And of course, because I am fat, ugly, have glasses, I would never have had a chance with her, but she talked to me, we would text eachother until we will meet, I would tell her everything, literally everything about me, my darkest secrets, she did the same. \nNow I've got my GCSEs (for those who don't know, they are the exams that decide your future in England), failing everything (even though I was an ace in everything back in Romania and the stuff I do here is easier), i just can't do anything, just can't. I feel like breaking down crying everyday in the hallway when passing anyone. No one makes me feel like she does, she doesn't have a boyfriend or anything, if she did I would be more happy because she would be more happy, but the fact that I am the way I am and I look the way I look is going to stop her from ever thinking about me. She only treated me like that this summer after telling her my past attempts of.. you know( let's not say the \"s\" word) It was all fake, it fu**ing hurts.\nIt is not all about her, not all about love, my friends that I've known since I was 4  I miss them.\nLet's go to the train thing, I think I might be boring you right now. I live in West London next to a train station, I take the train everyday, why shouldn't I just jump in front of one of those that go like 300km/h on Monday ? I don't care if no one will recognise me or stuff like that, i just want to end it, but a part of my brain stops me from it.\nI can't tell my parents, they will take it as a joke, can't tell anyone at school because f*** them, they don't care.\nAlso my parents told me we will never go back to Romania so...\nThere is just no one I can talk to, but her.\nYeah,let's go back to her, to Beatrice, what a beautiful name isn't it ? She is also beautiful, not in the sexual way, I am not that kind of person, she is just gorgeous, you are gorgeous Beatrice, you will never know it, I never told you, but I love you and always will.\nI decided, on monday I will do it, I will jump in front of it, first day of school after 2 weeks of holidays, not like anyone will care anyway, not even her.\nGoodbye Beatrice, goodbye Reddit, goodbye to whoever is reading this, thank you if you made it this far, cheers",

I tried to kill myself about 15-16 years ago, nearly had done it to had I not sent my gf an email in the middle of the night(hoping she wouldn\u2019t see it until she got home from school the next day, for some reason she woke up in the middle of the night and checked her email and called 911). Anyways, my heart had stopped and I ended up in a coma for about three-four days. After that life was fine for a while until I started drinking and became an alcoholic. Stopped drinking and became a heroin addict. Stopped doing heroin and now have almost four years clean. I have absolutely nothing to show for my life except for, well really nothing. I have a criminal record from being arrested for heroin possession. I can\u2019t get a pardon until I pay off all the money I owe in fines, which is about $2,500. I have no license. I\u2019m currently 379lbs, severely obese. I have no energy to do anything. I cry myself to sleep almost every single night, when I can sleep that is. Which is usually never. My sister is going off to college this year, 13 years younger than me. And here I am living in the basement and can\u2019t even get a job. My family life growing up was fucked up. My parents divorced and my dad married this wretched woman. She abused me from the time I was 10 until, honestly pretty much now. Not physical but psychologically and verbally. By telling me I was stupid and worthless and all this other shit. Would complain to my dad, they would fight, and then it would just happen again. I\u2019m not looking for sympathy or anything I just needed to vent. I\u2019ve lost so many friends to heroin and in the back of my mind I always think why couldn\u2019t it have been me, why am I still here! I can hear my dad talking to my sister about networking with his colleagues and what not. While I sit here with nothing. Both of my siblings play sports and are very good, my dad is so proud of them and here I am, just absolutely fucking nothing!! I\u2019m thirty-one and my dads never told me he loves me. I\u2019m just a fucking failure. I\u2019m not suicidal or anything, I just needed to get this out in some way. It\u2019s fucking eating me alive. I know my mom loves me but I just I don\u2019t fucking know. No one has ever been proud of me. Every day I say to myself maybe tomorrow will be better and then it\u2019s just the fucking same. I want to do something with my life so that I can be proud of myself. I can\u2019t even bring myself to get out of bed to brush my fucking teeth!! \n\nAnyways, enough is enough. Maybe tomorrow will be better. \n\nSorry for wasting anyone\u2019s time, this is mostly for me. Thanks, guys/gals.  ",

            "selftext": "Hi there. 18M from UK here, simply put I've failed college 3 times now, tried applying for apprentiships, no luck though, mostly cause of my GCSE results which were barely average.\n\nWorst part is my parents still think that I'm still in college and have been faking it since I left for the third time now in January 2018.\n\nNever was very social at all, almost complete introvert and the few friends I had left either moved on, stopped communicating or both. Went out with two girls once but that's as far as I got in any serious relationships lol. Still have FB but don't use it at all really and only really keep the account open because of all the pics on the account that aren't stored anywhere else.\n\nNow it's getting close to the end of the college year and the closer it gets, the more my parents will start to figure that I've been lying for well over 6 months.\n\nI mostly just try to occupy myself, mostly with video games but it sometimes feels like the walls are actually closing in, mostly get these feelings at night when I don't have anything else to think about but this topic.\n\nTwo sides of me tell two different stories.\n\nOne side says that I'm an 18 year old virgin with a tiny dick who failed his exams because of his addiction to video games and fear of failure. That when my parents find out they will kick me out then I won't be able to end it at all. That I'm either spending the rest of my days stacking shelves somewhere or just ending it right now.\n\nThe other side is telling me not to do it because of the pain, not to myself but to everyone around me, my dad is close to retirement and I'm probably the most important person he cares about and there's a risk that he might try and join me on the other side of the fence. My mum lives alone and will be equally crushed. My cousins will blame themselves, my friends will feel guilty. My parents were amazing and gave me much more than I deserve yet they will blame themselves and call themselves bad parents. If I'm not mistaken this kind of pain is also the reason that other people don't do it, that in the end you will be hurting other people no matter what.\n\nThought about different methods of how I would go. I settled for Carbon Monoxide poisoning as the most painless but not necessarily quickest way to go. Worst outcome would be the exit failing and ending up with brain damage of some kind. I don't exactly prefer ekeing out an existance with the intelligence of an apple.\n\nI'm just rambling at this point and posting on reddit to make other people give me sympathy and to make myself feel better.\nSuicide is often seen as experiancing so much emotional pain that you can't take it anymore, for me it just seems like reasoning a pros and cons of a decision, just asking whats the point of this? At all?\n\n",

            "selftext": "Sorry if this offends anyone. I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts lately. I'm tired of being transgender and I'm fucking tired of politics. Not only is it physically exhausting and stressful to be trans, but the amount of bullshit I hear from people is almost unbearable. Most people, in my experience, think being transgender is a mental illness that they should \"seek help for\", and that seems to be the popular opinion. The translation of that seems to be \"you're weird and that's not normal so it must be a mental illness, go away\". Hurts even worse when most of the people you used to admire seem to think that way. \n\n\nI'm tired of my existence being a political statement. I just want to exist. I just want to be treated with respect and seen as myself. But since I have such a rare condition, especially one that's so controversial, having a normal life seems impossible. I also feel like a lot of hatred for transgender people comes from the \"sjw\" types of people found on Tumblr, who have turned us into complete jokes. \n\n\nI don't think being trans is normal. I wish every day I was normal. I do think it is a medical condition, but not a mental illness. As far as I'm aware, it's due to a mismatched brain and body. From the research I've done, it's neurological. Unfortunately, most people don't know that and they don't care to. And why would they, trans people are such a small minority. It's one of the most misunderstood medical conditions. I'm never going to be seen as a human being. People have outright told me I'm not a person because I'm trans. \n\n\nI don't think this will ever go away. I'm never going to find someone who loves me for who I am, I'm never going to be seen as anything other than a freak, and when I try to stand up for myself I'm a \"triggered special snowflake who can't handle differing opinions\", despite being a political moderate who tries to listen to all sides before forming an opinion. I really do feel like I'm not worth the air I breathe and I would be better off dead. I feel like the world doesn't want people like me in it. Maybe they're right, maybe I am just mentally ill and no matter how hard I try, I'll never be \"real\", only a mutilated imitation. It's kind of hard not to feel worthless and disgusting. No matter what I do, it'll never be enough.",

I just want to be alone and gather myself and appreciate how lucky I am and instead people are acting really overly concerned and it just makes me feel more worthless.\n\nNow it's making me think that I can't really fuck it up the next time I do something like that because I'm only gonna make things worse.

            "selftext": "After a fifth failed attempt to leave my boyfriend, and now realizing that I've lost the opportunity of a lifetime because of it, and I have to continue the endless cycle of dating my boyfriend till one of us dies (I can't leave, I keep trying but don't have the willpower to do it), I've decided to hop off the bridge. \n\nI want to email my suicide note to a lost love in life...but I think it would devastate him to read it. It seems like a cruel last thing to do, but I want to go knowing he will read it, he's so important to me and I would give the world to have spent my life with him - but I made my choice 10 years ago to date the man I'm with, and with him I forever must stay and thus my time in this world must come to a fabled close. \n\nI find the hardest part, aside from choosing who to send this email to, is in the things I'll miss - discoveries in space, video games, heck I haven't even tried VR yet, all the beautiful animals in this world - but I know living with my boyfriend, contining to live this life...even if I see or experience those things, they taste like ash, they feel like nothing, I am numb to it all. If only I could be alone, single, independent even...that too I would RELISH in. Or to experience an entirely different lifestyle, to live openly bi, or poly for that matter, to not suppress ones desire day in, day out. I've crafted the perfect persona for my own pain, and only my boyfriend really knows, and oh how I just weep for the day he will say \"I break up with you, go away\" but I know it will never come because he has me, I'm his and kept and he knows I'll never find the courage to leave.",

            "selftext": "This is just so ridiculous. I feel that I am not actually killing myself just because I know it would make the life of my family miserable. But I see them being miserable sometimes and I guess they are thinking the same. Actually, they are often talking about quick painless death as of something they wish happens to them. So what is the big deal then? Why are we all clinging to each other? Just in order to extend our invasive species? \n\nI am just so tired of being an animal with traces of conciseness that is trying to make sense of this pointless existence. Why do we need reasoning when it just makes us confused?\n\nI know I am going through a tough period, but this is not the first time I am asking myself these questions.\n\nAs a chemist, I have access to some very poisonous stuff. For example, there is a big bottle of sodium azide on the shelf in my laboratory; if you take only 700 mg of this stuff you are done. I know I will not do that, but it is so tempting. Dissolving at least 10 g of it in water, downing it with some vodka and waiting on top of some bridge for the symptoms to kick in and then jumping. I think there is no way back after this. Such a waste of all this education society invested in me, just to be able to kill myself efficiently. This is what I am thinking about.\n\nThe only thing that is calming me down is music and nature (I mean all non-human-made things, even like watching a lost ant walking around). As I already ended up in this pitiful state, maybe I should stop caring about almost everything I was doing till now and try to spend more time in nature somewhere in mountains (which I tried already and it was enjoyable).\n\nEt voila!",

It\u2019s like everyone is riding into the sunset or like a child who has to stay inside during recess while everyone else plays outside. That\u2019s the perfect analogy for my life. I\u2019ve also become such a couch potatoe, I can\u2019t even walk downstairs without feeling like I\u2019m going to faint or getting Intense vertigo, or go outside without feeling super lightheaded and seeing an excessive amount of floaters in my vision. Like what the fuck I should at least have control of my faculties at 21 years old. Fuck I have notnijg else to say, anyone care to talk or empathize at least, it\u2019s comforting to know I\u2019m not alone ",

But they all (mom, dad, older brother, younger brother) came to a conclusion to kick me out because I kept getting angry. No one asked me what happened.\n\nThe thought of my family having gone through with this plan with no remorse, feeling justified and kicking me out with no glasses, food, money, clothes... Just to a month's notice to find work and support myself is soul wrenching...\n\nHow can they let me sleep in the streets? Get raped? Be hungry. I never slept in the street because I had friends, but what did my family know? All they know is they kicked me out with no resources to succeed. It was my will that got me through it. I hustled.\n\nNow... I'm set to be moving back home after 5 years due to financial hardship and all these memories are arising. In the time that has passed, my dad passed away and all my siblings moved out. My mother and I have reconciled even though she said I can't live there if I get mad again like that. I just don't trust my mom. I don't think I can ever trust her again. \n\nI just wanna die. I can't handle all this heartbreak anymore. Family is supposed to be there for you, especially at your lowest. But they only seem to want me at my best and are happy to discard me at my worst. Calling the cops on me for throwing newspaper on the floor... Further traumatizing me... Making me feel like if I am not who they want me to be, I am not worth their time\n\nI want to go back to God...",

            "selftext": "So far, I haven't gone through with it. I know how I will if I decide to go through with it (asphyxiation in the garage). I know exactly what I'll say in my final letter because I've been saying it and writing it and basically just shy of screaming it to everyone for the last 3 years, and nobody will truly listen.\n\nVery recently I've received some good news, and I know when part of this hell I've been living will end. 13 months. I can try to get everything in order by then so that when the time comes and it's at the \"make or break\" moment, I'll be ready for the permanent break.\n\nBasically I found meaning in life and that meaning was ripped away from me 3 years ago. In 13 months, I'll be able to try and make that meaning happen again, to try and become whole again. If I can't, I can honestly say it will be THE most likely time I'll kill myself. Not when I was in jail, nor in the years after, nor losing all my friends and having no career or income and becoming the fattest I've ever been in my life... But all hinging on this one thing.\n\nAnd that's okay. Because if it doesn't happen, I know it never will, and then there is no longer a reason to live. I know I will hurt others. I know it's a selfish decision. I know I could keep living and struggling and being unhappy. I've accepted my life up to this point, and accept my fate should things not work out. I used to believe that \"there's always hope\" as my ex used to tell me, but should everything count for nothing, then that's where my hope, and thus my life, will be.\n\nI know I'm being vague, but frankly even here I would face judgement should I say what I want to say openly, and I don't want to explain myself or my situation.\n\nI don't expect this to be read until after my death, if at all. I just wanted to get this out into words as it's been something on my mind lately.",

BUT I did that one Drug... That one time.. Only once. Nbome. A research chemical like LSD....This was November 2013...I was 19....\n\nI can say that at first, I was fine... Had multiple jobs....( ADHD)   But late 2014, Ibegin to question my self.... Why cant I socialize with society correctly... Why do I act stupid... Also, Why was my character so childish and happy?I had a tremendous Joy for Life.... Chakra meditator. Loved Life... I Still do... \n\nBut I have slowly degrated myself somehow... And Now I think Im stuck on a Trance..... \nI was fine... But throughout the uears of lack of confidence and NOT WORKING, Ive developed a traumatic responce to something that is long gone... But I feel like it came back. Ive been actively sharing this feeling since 2016..\nJust a year ago my family found out..... \n\nIt hurts me more, knowing they are affected. And they are sad because they dont know what to do... The days pass by... Amd im still a typical 24 year old.\n\nI had friends who are married, woth  children, graduated from universitied, became freelamcers.. Or doing something for themselves...\n\nAnd I cant move on..... Without thinking im in a Trance, LUCID DREAM.....\n\nLife is soo fucken beautiful.. Theres alot to admire. We can sing play have fun enjoy eachothers company.... We can work hard foe what we want......\n\nWe have a pine tree. It was small when we first git it it 2015... Someone broke the main stem were its growth was leading.....\n\nNow in 2018, It not only developed a new center point, but It is surpassing the other pine tree...\n\nNature regenerates.... And so can you...\n\nBut I feel like im stuck..... Dont know what to do.\nI feel like homelessness is my only option....\n\nBut this isnt about me its about you, the reader...\nHope mybexperience can help you realize that you can move on and heal... just like the pine tree.....

            "selftext": "Hello all. I've been severely bi polar for 6 years which began to manifest itself in suicidal thoughts. After months of getting into better shape, seeking help, trying to repair and improve my social life, I still want to die and my symptoms are worsening, so after realizing this I've given up. I have stopped showing up to most of my university classes and completely isolated myself. Ive lost 17 pounds in 3 weeks because I'm too anxious to eat regularly. All I think about is walking into a hospital or something and shooting myself in the head. These thoughts make me happy until I think about my family. I hate myself which makes me want to die but I hate myself more for wanting to die. I feel like nothing matters anymore. I feel like my fate is already sealed and it's over. I'm in so much pain.\n\nAm I actually in danger of killing myself or will this pass?",

I\u2019m waiting for the therapist or whoever to come in, but I don\u2019t know when that will be since they come see people in the ER in between patients. \n\nI hurt myself because I feel like I\u2019ve ruined my life. I\u2019ve had sex with people in the double digits, manipulated and lied to a lot of them about my age (I look much older than I really am). I hate all the people I let crawl inside my body. I gave myself away to whoever would have me, I had no self respect and couldn\u2019t even comprehend the consequences. I did just about every drug I could get my hands on. I was a humongous slut. All this happened from when I was 12-13, and then I came to my senses a few months ago. I\u2019ve been trying to change so much, but I feel like nobody will ever want a disgusting slut like me. That someday everybody will find out what I\u2019ve done in the past and abandon me, which has happened with a guy I liked before. He found out I had sex with two of his ugly, horrible friends and dropped me. That sent me even further down into this awful dark place. I wish I was innocent and pure and happy again. I wish I wasn\u2019t such a reckless fuck up. I don\u2019t want to tell my parents what I\u2019ve done. My mom knows I\u2019m not a virgin, but she doesn\u2019t know the extent of it all. I got tested awhile ago, it\u2019s an absolute miracle I\u2019m 100% clear of any STDs. \n\nI feel so guilty about even kissing somebody now. \n\nI have this secret I carry around with me every day. Everybody will be disgusted and hate me. My brother knows a lot of what I did, he called me a massive slut. And it\u2019s true. The worst part about this is that I did all of this to myself. \n\nI feel like there\u2019s no way out of this except to die. I already ruined my life. If I ever wanted to be successful in the public eye (I used to do acting and stuff) then somehow everybody would find out. Or somebody I lied to in the past about my age to have sex with me would find out (the oldest I\u2019ve ever been with was 22. I was 12. A majority of all the people were older than me.) \n\nI don\u2019t deserve to live. I am in constant guilt and shame for what I\u2019ve done. This would be so much easier if it was just some chemical imbalance in my head or something I\u2019m not responsible for. I know everybody makes mistakes, but I did this all to myself. Me. And I should pay the consequences. ",

            "selftext": "**TL;DR** *I have thought about killing myself everyday for years. The reasons are pretty dumb though. I don't think much of it and feel like if I did kill myself it wouldn't be too big of a deal. I feel like it would be normal. Does everyone think like this?*\n\n\n\n\n\nEver since a young teen I've always wanted to kill myself. I thought nothing of it, and figured it was no big deal. I even told my parents, and they were heartbroken and I couldn't understand why. Back then, I definitely wanted to kill myself because things overwhelmed me too easily. Every time I stepped outside of my comfort zone I thought it was the end of the world, so I made sure to never do it and thus never achieved anything. I dropped out of piano and never tried to do anything after school.\n\nNowadays, I still think about killing myself on the regular, but for a different reason. I basically live outside of my comfort zone now, and only feel at peace when I'm at work or with my friends. So many things scare me in life, but I face them anyways. I've never told anyone besides my mom and dad I am suicidal, because I don't think I am I think I just have these thoughts because it feels normal to want to kill myself.\n\nI have nothing to look forward to at the moment, but I know that will change and I am too stupid to reassure myself of that. I think, \"It would be great if I killed myself,\" because then I wouldn't have to deal with things that make me uncomfortable. The people I live with, my tiny social circle, and my failing ambition is really what gets to me.\n\nI care way too much of what people think of me. If someone even thinks remotely bad of me I take it incredibly personally, and I'm not sure why. My brother and cousin think I might be autistic, so I feel like the chemistry of my brain is just difficult to live with. I can't afford to see a specialist, however. I remember a few moments in my life that really got to me. One time the people I live with, my friend's parents because I didn't like living at home, had a talk with me about my habits and they are not approved. The talk was nothing more than if your dishes are dirty put them on the counter instead of in the sink, but months later I still can't shake the feeling that I disappointed them that badly. I remember when I made my dad incredibly angry one day because I took a shower before he wanted to and he had no hot water. He thought something was wrong with me for thinking that that was an ok idea. I remember when this girl I used to date broke up with me. I asked her why, and she didn't even know she said she just felt like she needed to. It's been months and I am still trying to figure out what I could have been like to make someone go from having me as one of their favorite people in the world to hating me. I think it was because I started to be myself around her more and that wasn't ok. Even today I called one of my friends because my car is in the shop and I have nothing to do so I was thinking maybe she could distract me, but it was clear she didn't want to talk to me and ended the conversation almost immediately. I couldn't help but think, \"wow I'm that uninteresting.\"\n\nThese things are just normal every day experiences that everyone has. It kind of makes me mad that I'm forcing whoever is reading this to hear me talk about myself and wasting their time. I do not struggle with depression I feel like. I feel like if there's a situation that warrants enjoyment I will enjoy it and if there is one that does not I will try to make the most of it. Last night my tire got flat and I was pretty mad about that, which is probably understandable, but only for maybe 10 minutes or so. Instead of something terrible like having to spend $200 on a new tire, what gets to me is when someone just displays something that means they don't like me. Everyday I have some kind of suicidal thought, but I think nothing more of it. It's the same kind of thought as \"wow this food I'm eating is good,\" or \"i should probably shave today.\" Lately those have been my only thoughts. I haven't eaten in days because I can't stop thinking about how I want to die. I'm a little scared to though. \n\nI have 2 cats and they are the most precious things in the world. My life revolves around these two and everything I do I wish I could do for them. I will not kill myself if it means anything to my cats. Because of this, I'm not looking for ways or advice on why I shouldn't do it, but instead I'm asking why do I feel like it all the time and do other people feel suicidal for seemingly no reason?\n\nIf it matters, I'm 19, work full time, and study computer science.",

            "selftext": "I started Wellbutrin like 2 or 3 weeks ago because I have depression and anxiety and finally wanted to get help with it. The first week of Wellbutrin I felt very energized, I still felt shitty and sad but I was very energetic and easily distracted so I thought maybe I could direct my new powers into not feeling so sad. That feeling wore off after the first week or so. Now I feel very differently. Just like overwhelming despair. I have been crying heavily every day and having suicidal feelings.\n\n\nThe thing is I can't tell if it's the medication or if my life is actually shitty. My dog of 14 years died recently, I spend so much time with him whenever I was depressed or lonely. Now I don't have anything to fill that void.\n\n\nI have a boyfriend but I don't think it's a good relationship, he doesn't think very highly of me (puts me down a lot, calls me stupid, fat, ugly, bad in bed, etc.) and doesn't like spending time with me (I begged him just to go see a movie with me and he stood me up). The worst thing is that I overheard a conversation he had with a friend, his friend got to sleep with this girl we know before he did, I guess he really wanted to be with her because she is a model and very pretty and slim. I felt so low ever since I heard that. I can't even describe how much that hurt me. I have been carrying that hurt around for a long time. My boyfriend has never called me beautiful or pretty and I'm pretty sure he's only with me because of my money. I guess that's the only thing I can offer someone.\n\n\nI don't have very many friends, and the ones I do have barely talk to me. If I try to hang out with them, we make plans and then they will cancel at the last possible second. I've even had a friend stand me up twice. That really hurt. I have a hard time making new friends, I can never get people to be interested in me. It's almost impossible for me\u00a0to make it past the acquaintance stage. It just kind of fizzles out.\n\n\nI have a great job and make pretty good money, I'm independent and finally getting somewhere in life after being down so long\u00a0but I feel so crushingly lonely and honestly pathetic. I feel like I'm not a person worth spending time with. I feel like I'm very ugly and gross and men aren't attracted or interested in me. I feel nobody would really care if I died, and maybe that is a good thing and I should do it because it feels like nobody wants me or cares for me.\n\n\nMy psychiatrist told me to call her if I start feeling this way, but the more I think about it, the more it feels like \"the right thing to do\". Imagining my own death actually makes me feel a little good and I don't know why. I think I will call her soon, but I am sad to stop taking the Wellbutrin because the energy boost actually makes me feel like a functional human being. But also a worthless one.\n\n\nI just needed to write this out, thank you for reading if you did",

Now all I can think about is clearly I don't deserve any kind of help, I'm just overdramatic, I'm not sick, and I'm a huge problem for everybody around me. Aren't these people supposed to help?",

I self-harm and often feel like this is not real life - like i\u2018m a character in a video game or movie.\nToday I had a very bad day.\nI don\u2019t want to go to in-depth but it felt like I had no control over anything at all and that I was just going to fail\neverything and everything. I hated myself and all I could think of was to kill myself after school.\nI often fantasised about how people would react to my death and today all I could think about was how to kill\nmyself, what to write in my note, etc.\nI was so close to doing it but managed to convince myself not to. My grandmother lives at my house so she would notice if I did something. She might try to stop me.\nBut now, my grandmother is going to go on vacation, and so no one will be home.\nI\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll do something.\nI don\u2018t like therapy and even if I\u2018d wait until the next session, I could already have a chance to do something.\nWhat should I do? \n\nThank you for reading.\n\n \n",

So I thought why not change to nature (don't know what it's called in English im from Sweden so that's what we call it) If I do, I get to continue with the second graders if only if their space for an extra student (me) but I have to do some test on the subjects they have which I think I can make also they can adjust my schedule to add more subjects on the third grade. \n\n\nThere are basically two routes for me that are an ish not sure if it could happen but I hope If not I can just kill myself have tried to get jobs but they always decline so I don't know what to do if I can get into Nature then I don't what to do with my life just wasted. I'm allergic don't know a way without HS and college/university grades to get a job. If I get a no on both of the options I see then I might just kill myself as the only option. *edit tried to make space",

I'm clearly depressed, I need help, but I have no means of getting it. I'm in chronic pain every day, it all hurts, and I can't take painkillers for it because of my addiction.\n\nI don't know what I'm doing or why but I just wanted to say it to someone. I can barely get it out without my family getting enraged. They react to every problem I have with anger (whether its mental or physical). \n\nI just feel like a burden. That everyone would be better off without me.",

            "selftext": "Here's my story, I've been suffering with depression for most of my life at this stage, my dad left at a very young age, I've had pretty much no male influence in my life. I've spent pretty much my whole life with my mom and sisters, they haven't always treated me very well and I think that's one of the main causes for my depression.\n\nI've never really been very interested in having relationships with people because it's hard enough just to keep myself stable and happy so having someone else I have to make happy is out of the question. My depression always comes back whenever I'm at a good point in my life which ends up with me getting fired from my job and isolating myself from friends.\n\nIt's a vicious cycle that doesn't seem to end no matter what I try to do about it, and last year I decided to give up, I was planning to kill myself on Christmas Day 2017 but my mom found out earlier in December and I was forcefully sectioned from Dec 3rd through to Dec 29th when I was finally discharged. It's now April, I'm not working yet because I don't feel ready, my new meds aren't exactly giving me the desired effect and little things keep chipping away at me and I feel like I'm even more easily depressed now.\n\nI'm just so bored of life in general, I mean I know for a fact I'm going to build myself back up again and then the depression is going to drag me back down again and that's what scares me.\n\nI've been thinking about planning suicide again but this time I'm definitely not going to let anyone close to me find out about it because I can't stand to be sectioned again.\n\nI'm not really looking for answers, I just needed a safe space to get something off my chest.

            "selftext": "Last year around this time I never would've thought that I'd be in this situation.\n\nBack in September I was a college student, struggling with a class that was causing me stress. I wanted to drop it but I couldn't because my dad (who pays the tuition) said that if I dropped under 12 credits, he'd \"jam me up\". That, combined with an upcoming exam in the class, pushed me to suicide.\n\nI took 200 pills, where I regretfully texted my mom 'I'm sorry', and the university police were in my dorm room. \n\nI had to do inpatient.\n\nI thought I was ready to return to class after missing 2 weeks of classes, but I wasn't. I was overwhelmed and ended up dropping all of my classes one by one. \n\nSince I left in the middle of the semester, I had to pay the balance I owed to the school. 1K. My dad made it clear that he would not help. Neither would my mom. They said that if I paid for my own education, I'd be less likely to kill myself. Just yesterday, my dad said he's not going to help me return to school because he is still affected by my suicide attempt six months ago.\n\nBut that's the thing. I need to go back to school. I'm a shut-in living in an area where you need a car to do anything. I can't drive and my parents refuse to teach me because they don't want me to kill myself. Yet my dad says things to me like \"you're in this situation because you don't do what I tell you.\" and yells at me when I try to tell him how I feel.\n\nI don't have anyone my own age to talk to. The only time I leave the house is to see my therapist and psychiatrist. So I've decided to get a job.\n\nHowever, when I did get a job at the end of December as a pharmacy technician, I had a break down on the first day on the job and quit. Ever since then, I haven't been able to find a job. I've gotten a few interviews, probably because I went to school from 2013-2017, and it looks like I graduated. (I didn't. I dropped out in 2015 and returned in 2016. I even say no degree but they ignore it) As soon as I clarify that I don't have a degree, the tone of the interview changes.\n\nSince then, I have not been able to find a job. I've been searching for 6 months. At first I was only looking in clerical and administrative, but for the last two months I opened up to anything that doesn't explicitly say degree required, including minimum wage jobs. Yet I still don't get anything.\n\nMy aunt and cousin believe this is because God is punishing me for not going along with his plan of me being a pharmacy technician. I'm not religious in the slightest, but I believe(d) there is a God. However, I believe that they are right. Especially because my prayers are going unanswered, and things are getting worse. My belief in a god now is wavering.\n\nI've opened myself to jobs in cities where my family lives, using their addresses. However, still... nothing. I need to get out of this state. There's nothing here, but I can't. I can't leave. You can't leave when you're balls deep in debt and have no money. \n\nYes... Not only do I owe 1K to the school (which I am to start paying on April 30th, I arranged the payment plan for two months ago because I thought I'd have a job by then) but my student loans start being repaid next month. I am going to defer them but at the same time... The stress of it over my head is...\n\nIt doesn't help that my sister, who is 18 months younger than me, is doing so well. She's a compsci major and will be graduating next fall. She has a car and an apartment and will probably get a nice job. People say that I can't compare myself to her, but it's hard not to when you have nothing going on.\n\nAs for my therapist and psychiatrist... I had to see them when I left inpatient thanks to the social worker. The psychiatrist is more helpful because the meds did help, but the therapist... I've been through 3. The first was a horrible one that pushed for a family session and then completely ignored everything I said for my dad. The second one was great and we were actually making progress but she left the practice. The current one... she is giving me job seeking tips like I haven't done them already. A lot of people do that, and it makes me feel worse.\n\nI think I'm at the point where therapists can't help me, because my issues are external. The only way I can feel better is if I get a job. But therapists can't do that. Unfortunately, I have to see a therapist to keep my psychiatrist.\n\nI've planned to do it on April 30th. At this point, nothing can change my mind. It's like... if you don't have a college degree, you aren't meant to live. It's like some kind of natural selection... where the \"uneducated\" die off... I'm just stuck. I've always felt stuck no matter what I do. I'm 23, but my life feels like it's over before it began.\n\nBefore, I used to tell myself that if I killed myself, I would go to hell. However... Now I don't care. God clearly hates me anyway. As I was typing this up I got another rejection email. Nice. That's clearly all I deserve.\n\nPeople keep telling me that a job is coming and that it all works out in the end and that when you're at the end of your rope it always turns around. If that's true, why isn't it changing for me? What am I doing wrong? Why is everything getting worse when it should be getting better? I don't want to know the answer to that question. But what I do know is that life is bullshit, and I'm giving up. It's all my fault.\n\nThank you for reading. (I'm posting this from the app so I'm hoping the formatting isn't weird)",

            "selftext": "Throughout my life I've had these messages sent to me constantly.  Such unbelievable bad luck -- literally beyond what all reason and probability we've been taught as \"real\"...\n\nAnd last's night's little Hate Note from God wouldn't be a huge deal to anyone else.  A medium sized dog [who I love(d?)], destroyed a seemingly indestructible table that I also loved -- the physics of which literally make ZERO sense.  The point is: furniture and space.  I have no HOME because my possessions are not safe because *her* possessions are building up and burying them all and pushing even the dog into tighter and tighter spaces until she innocently destroys something I love...  It makes no sense to you, but it's a fucking symbol of how irrelevant I, my things and my feelings have become in my own home.\n\nNothing will ever get any better.  Everything always gets worse.  I'm too old to have children now, so there's really no point in finishing out the next ~30 years.  \n\nMy job is shit.  My friends have real lives of their own.  My body is falling apart.  My mind has long since been ruined.  I'm constantly broke.  I'll never even be able to afford my own house (anywhere near a place where I could find work anyway).\n\nAnd my relationship is an unfathomable tangle of bullshit and inexplicable guilt trips....  it's ending, and I can't bear to admit that because I'm too old, fat and ugly now to ever be accepted by anyone else ever again.  I AM **SO** FUCKING ANGRY AND RESENTFUL OF ALL THE BULLSHIT WE'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH SINCE HER GRANDMOTHER DIED AND SHE WENT OFF ON THIS NEW CRUSADE.....\n\nBefore that there was a PLAN that was feasible.  Now she wants to be a nurse and go to nursing school and FINANCIALLY RUIN US BOTH WHILE **ALSO** RUINING THE HOUSE IN WHICH WE LIVE BY BUYING MORE AND MORE FURNITURE WHEN THERE'S NO FUCKING ROOM FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nSo the relationship has to end.  Which means I have to end.  Because I can't survive \"dating\" again -- anyone, for any reason.  (Besides, I snore and that makes me an unlovable monster apparently -- and the goddamn incompetent CPAP tech refuses to let me try the full-face mask... it doesn't matter)  Fuck that shit.  I'd rather die.  \n\nAnd I know the spot.  There's a road across the way from our house and down at the far end there's an empty lot with lots of trees and a pretty stream.  Let the city clean up the mess.  \n\nAnd let her live as long as she can, happily in her piles upon piles of furniture and horseshit that are suffocating me and turning our house into a goddamn garbage dump.  (Which will be less than 1 month because I pay for literally everything -- but am not allowed to sleep in my own bed or even own a table without it being destroyed)",

            "selftext": "I just need to get it off my chest, as I do not see anyone professionally or talk to my family about my suicidal tendencies..\n\nAnyway, about 1 year ago I attempted my first suicide. I was in the dumps so much I needed to escape (kinda like now tbh). I have an insomnia were I am stimulated by my own thoughts. Kinda like when people get stimulated by their phones, but it's by my thoughts. And to add to that, the thoughts were of suicide.. Anyway, because of my lack of sleep, my parents took to me the doctor who prescribed me some heavily sleeping pills. These certain pills I would take after dinner and after a shower, and then I'd lay in bed for about 45 minutes and they'd completely knock me out. Like involuntarily knock me out. (Keep in mind I am meant to take 2 for it to work)\n\nAnyway, so the day comes... I pretend to take the tablets. And then wait impatiently in my bed till around 1am. I go out into the kitchen and down 8 pills. 4x the recommended amount. I cry my self to sleep, and boom, it's all black. My vision fades.\n\nI, unfortunately, wake up to my mother screaming in my face to wake up and that I was late for school. I felt horrible and it really hurt my lower stomach. I climb out of my bed sleepily and chuck on my school shirt. I entered school and went straight to the change room, and sleep on one of the benches. Luckily, I'm not an important person, so I wake up around 2pm and walk to my math class. She looks at me and then gestures me to sit down. I sit down and sleep through the class.\n\nI get home from school and sleep until 10am. That means I haven't eaten breakfast, lunch, dinner. So you can imagine how shit I felt \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnyway thanks for reading.",

I can't imagine ever getting out of this family and even if I can someday I feel so hopeless at the thought of enduring this shit for at least 5~6 more years. I know it's a short time compared to my whole life but I can't get myself to think logically. I don't know how I'll ever get myself to another country, I don't know how I'm gonna get the money, I don't even know the legal procedures and shit and it's stupid to be thinking of this all now but it gives me so much anxiety. I can't stand the thought of spending more time here and my school years are gonna be hell. The pressure is killing me and I'm just going to be isolated for so many more years and I can't take it. Even if I get myself through somehow I can't imagine being happy. I don't see the point of going through all this and I just want to be free.",

            "selftext": "Hi, this is my first time posting on this site (I made this account specifically for this post). I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m posting this, maybe just to tell my story. \nI\u2019m a 24 male and suffered with depression since I was about 10. Throughout my shitty life I\u2019ve been bullied, over weight, and abandoned (I know sounds like a generic teenage loser film lol). I was suffering through my depression alone until I was 22 and I never told a soul about my plans of suicide until that year. I told my father first and I expected some kind of shock or worrying reaction. What I got was him telling me \u201c get a job\u201d and ignoring me for the next 3 months until I left to go live with my mother. A little background on my father; when my mother got pregnant with me, he came out of the closet as gay and left her. Since then he has only used me and my fragile state for his own benefit while mocking and berating me in private. I don\u2019t want you all to get the wrong idea, I don\u2019t hold any resentment towards him for leaving but what he told me was the last straw of a long line of issues. I no longer talk to him and I don\u2019t regret it. \nI later told my mother who sent me to see a psychiatrist the next day. I was diagnosed with depression (shocking I know) and was prescribed medication and therapy. I also went to a support group where the teach how to act in normal society. \nThroughout this entire process, I\u2019ve lost most of my family, my friends who I made in college stopped talking to me, including my \u201cbest friend\u201d. People who I thought would support me are now gone and I have no one. I haven\u2019t been accepted to any job that I\u2019ve applied to, part time included, and I\u2019m running out of places to apply. My degree is useless and I\u2019m broke. My mother is still supporting me and keeps telling me how much I have to give. Her saying that is just making me worse. I\u2019ve been told that all my life. School came easy to me( I don\u2019t mean to sound entitled or anything) and I was treated as an outcast because I wasn\u2019t allowed to move up to more advanced classes so I was treated like shit by almost all my classmates in high school. \nI internalized this into college so I never went to class and never took any internships or had any serious clubs. ( IF YOU READ ANYTHING IN HEAR READ THIS.  DONT YOU WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN ME MAKE THIS MISTAKE LIKE I DID) If you want to be successful you need these and I just thought they were useless things and another reason to be made fun of. After 6 years ( there was an issue where my abroad credit didn\u2019t transfer) I managed to graduate with a 3.0. ( I also retook a couple classes I failed so the grade replaced the failing grade). \nI\u2019ve lived my life thinking things would get better but I\u2019m just toxic. I\u2019ve somehow pushed away anyone who I thought cared about me ( including a girl I thought I loved). The only people I have left are my mother, little brother and sister (who resents me for \u201cabandoning\u201d my father). The world is just full of people who don\u2019t care, are sadistic and there\u2019s no hope for someone like me. Yesterday I had an argument with my stepfather and he told me how useless I was and how much of a waste of money and space I was. I told him I was going to kill myself to relieve everyone and he told me just not to do it in the house. I left to go I don\u2019t know where and ended up driving 100 miles away. The entire time I was considering how to kill myself without pain. My mother called me, concerned for me, and I decided not to do it that day. When I later told her what happened, she was upset but was defending my stepfather. I just don\u2019t know anymore. I don\u2019t think I want to die but I don\u2019t want to exist in this world. My dreams are gone and have dwindled down to winning the lottery and moving to the woods to be left alone. There\u2019s no hope for that though so I don\u2019t know what else to do. Anyway thanks for reading if you made it this far. ",

I don't even remember the last time someone hugged me. I miss my best friend most of all. I guess my fucked up life just became too much for her; now she has a new best friend, whom I've never met before, and has completely forgotten about me. I tried to reach out to her recently on her birthday, and she never replied. I don't think she even thinks about me anymore. I guess it's my fault though for isolating myself and making her feel abandoned. Sometimes, I feel hurt and angry, but I mostly just miss her, and the others, too. I just miss feeling loved. I miss having someone who wanted to talk to me, someone who would text me as soon as they woke up, and right before they fell asleep.

            "selftext": "I'm been suicidal since I was 13 (I'm 20 now), but recently it's been just outright awful. I've had 2 suicide attempts (the first one, I took around 15 pills of Tylenol only to wake up the next day perfectly fine; the second one I attempted to tie a noose and hang it on some tree but I failed miserably). These attempts were when I was 15 and 16. The problem now is I think too much, I really want to kill myself but the pain it would cause to my family holds me back.\n\nMy family is really supportive, and I fucking hate it. I wish I was born in a crappy household or was kicked out of the house when I was 18 so I wouldn't have a problem killing myself. If my suicide attempts were successful people would have been over it by now, so fuck you Tylenol.\n\nI find no meaning in living, I don't want to live and I don't want to try to be happy. I have virtually everything I want (loving family, enrolled in a university, upper-middle class, etc.) but none of this helps. My parents try to keep telling me to be thankful for what I have, but honestly I wish I was that kid that didn't have a loving family. I'm not here in really looking for help with my problem, I'm currently on anti-depressant medication called \"Bupropion\" but that isn't doing shit, nor is therapy.\n\nI become very anxious when I think about my future too. I've been a programmer since I was 13 and am pretty good at math, but when I think about what a programming job would be like it makes me feel even worse. How the fuck can someone program for hours on end non-stop? I have no other real talents, and I have no motivation to do anything. I don't have confidence and I'm also lonely. I cry pretty much every night angry that I can't leave this world. I want to be able to erase all memories of me so I can kill myself in peace. I'm a waste, why can't I trade places with someone who's terminally ill and wants to live?\n\nWhy the fuck do I care about how my family and close friends would feel if I killed myself? Like I'm going to be dead. Once I'm dead I won't be able to feel shit. I don't want to be alive and I don't see why suicide is so \"looked-down upon.\" I understand it's fucking permanent, THAT'S THE POINT. I know what being dead entails, why must I \"try to get better\" instead of \"convince my family suicide is my only option\"? There's no inherent value in life. People kill other people, we kill animals, animals kill us, environmental disasters wipe us out, etc. So what's so bad about a single life? Why is it fucking impossible for people to accept the fact that suicide is my only choice? And how the fuck is suicide selfish, it's MY OWN LIFE. I wish I wasn't here and the fucking OD on Tylenol killed me. Next time I make an attempt to kill myself I'll be sure to jump off an extremely high building and keep my neck up as I'm falling.\n\nI've tried talking to my therapist, saying that the solution would be having the ability to convince my family that I don't want to be imprisoned anymore. It's selfish that they want me to stay alive \"for them.\"\n\nI need to die, but it's very difficult for me to actually kill myself when I'm imagining my mother crying profusely. If God was real, my prayers would have been answered by now. Half a decade of praying to God to let me not wake up the next morning should have been enough. And I really hope God is not real, because if Heaven and Hell are real and I'm forced to be alive \"eternally,\" then what the actual fuck.",

            "selftext": "Navy blue suit. White shirt. Dark red tie to match the speckles of blood dotting the walls around me. Maybe I\u2019ll decide to put on my favourite pair of brown oxfords too.\n\nThat\u2019ll be the outfit I\u2019ll be in when I finally resign myself to the pull of Glock 22 trigger mechanism at 21 years old. A single pull to end all the bad thoughts. A single action to rescue myself from the torment of my dismal situation. That dismal situation you might ask? The ephemeral case of unrequited love.\n\nRight now I lay with a night where the moon shines baleful and bright. Its gentle light haunting my room. Had it been a year ago, I would be perfectly content in the company of only the moon. But I want more right now, I want a girl that can\u2019t want me back. When I confessed my feelings to her, she said she has a crush on me, but she\u2019s afraid to date. Reason being her religion. She\u2019s a witness and she\u2019s never been in a relationship before.\n\nWe still hang out a lot, and when I\u2019m with her I\u2019m the happiest guy in the world, but there\u2019s an inarticulable feeling looming in the crevices of my mind. People tell me I need to cut her out of my life. Easier said than done. I just can\u2019t rationalize myself to escape her presence, or form a healthy, cordial relationship with her where we\u2019re not boyfriend and girlfriend. I presently have the opportunity to, but my desire for me forbids me. And thus I am sad, and have been since the leaves started falling last year. \n\nDepression crashed itself into mind because I can\u2019t call her my girlfriend, with it the endless tides of sorrow, and thoughts of a future that I\u2019m not a part of. A future not being with the girl I really love, I\u2019ve told myself, that\u2019s not one I can endure. My heart flutters then aches when I think about her. Sometimes moments of delusions are maliciously cast into my mind. Delusions where we can be truly together. Only after they fade is my sadness exponential.\n\nThoughts have parsed my rotten mind with the idea that not existing wouldn\u2019t be so bad. That\u2019s where it started; a simple idea that not existing wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world. Then as I lay in bed, hopelessly forcing myself to fall asleep to escape reality, the thought crosses my mind that not waking up ever is seriously inviting. After hours battling with my thoughts, I am forced to waken in the early grey dawn, forced to meander to the subway to monotonous legal lectures, forced to deal with my thoughts of her all over again.\n\nI\u2019m weak-willed, I don\u2019t want to endure these thoughts anymore. I know time heals all wounds, but I don\u2019t want to wait. I can\u2019t anymore. I want to forcefully remove them from my mind. I think the power of ballistics firearms can aid me. I\u2019m taking the easy way out and I will wear my favourite suit whilst doing it. ",

            "selftext": "last year in the summer of 2017, i was diagnosed with a moderate/severe case of crohn's disease. for those who dont know, basically my immune system attacks its own digestive tract in certain areas (different for others) and this causes inflammation in it. for me and many others, its affecting my small and large intestine area. symptoms include defecating many many times a day (like 5-15 times a day for me), severe abdominal pain, decreased appetite, weight loss, and negative psychological effects indirectly caused by it. luckily, my insurance company was able to cover the costs for the first line of treatment for my case, which was basically a medication that i receive thru IV infusion every 4-8 weeks. not everyone reacts well to it, and if they do, your body may slowly develop a tolerance for this medication and itll stop working eventually. for me, its worked for about 8 months. 8 months of freedom. 8 months of living like a normal person. 8 months of not worrying about cramping from random foods or sudden urges to go to the bathroom. many times, i even forgot i had this disease because of how good i was on this medication. however, recently ive been experiencing pain in my abdominal area again, and it's worrying me. 4 days before my next infusion, which was today, i was experiencing extreme pain from around 1pm-4pm. that was strange because in the afternoon, night and during school, i felt completely fine (maybe hints of pain but nothing big). i though it would get better after i get my meds today again, but as of right now, im experiencing some kind of pain. idk if it was the 2 cups of coffee i drank in less than 3 hr time span giving me an average stomachache, or if my body is learning to fight off the medication, which would mean my crohns symptoms would reappear again. i know there are more options for treatment for me, but the fact that my medication is starting to possibly wear off is a sign that my condition is worsening. there is currently no cure for this disease. right now, im 16 yrs old, trying to live a normal life in the suburbs. theres no way i can deal with this disease anymore. i dont feel suicidal because of this, but its been a mental burden and im scared that im never gonna feel better ever again. if a cure ever becomes discovered for the public in the near future, i will never look back at these moments because these are the moments that make me realize that i have a chronic illness that is getting worse and worse everyday.

There is very little that can be don\u2019t to help me. The medicines only work for a very short period of time but as a result of anxiety combined with the physical affects of the medicines, my family always tells me how \u201cgood I\u2019m feeling\u201d. Little do they know that I am mentally crippled and literally dying because of everything going on. The anxiety has made me physically and mentally exhausted. The constant waves of severe suicidal impulses are crippling me and the OCD is just making things much worse with intrusive thoughts. The manic highs and lows of Bipolar are actually driving me insane. I have been hysterical, infuriated, and suicidal many times. The constant nostalgia that I experience as a result of my Autism makes life unbearably. I am constantly reminded of how great it used to be when I was younger and didn\u2019t have a thousand things to worry about. On top of all this, I am a Christian and I have scrupulosity due to OCD. Which makes me feel like I am literally doomed anyway. No chance of Heaven no matter what. Just eternal torment. The fear of hell that I have has actually caused me anxiety attacks and insomnia. Even though I try to be a model Christian and the light of the world. I feel like the biggest hypocrite ever. Telling people they will be okay and that God loves them when I don\u2019t even know if I believe it myself. To be honest, if I knew I was saved, I would end my life. I may do it anyway. I have been using massive amounts of caffeine, B12, three lorazepam, a day, Prozac two clonidine, four amytryptaline, and another pill for depression and I still feel like this. Stabbing waves of anxiety. Constant pounding waves of depression. Doubt, fear, confusion, anger, mania, pretty much every emotion and I can barely stand it anymore. I\u2019ll just slowly poison myself with all these chemicals. I really just want to be at peace!",

I\u2019ve got a job that I love, I love with 3 amazing roommates, and I have even been seeing someone! But now matter what I do, no matter how happy I seem in public, as soon as I\u2019m alone I\u2019m brought back to the reality that I am not happy. I have no idea what to do. I feel like everything I do has to be perfect, and even the slightest mistakes drive me insane. I\u2019ve just been so judgements of myself. I feel like no one cares about me, not that they even know how I feel. I don\u2019t want to be a burden on the people in my life. I do t want to be a bother. That\u2019s all I feel like, all the time. I\u2019ve had thoughts of ending it crop up recently, seemingly out of the blue. I struggled with heavy depression going through high school, but I seemed to overcome it on me own at the time. Maybe it\u2019s just repressed feelings? I don\u2019t know. It just doesnt feel worth it anymore. Anyways, I know this post is all over the place but thanks for listening. ",

Never have I been as happy as i was when I was naively in love, she could do no wrong. Well she did lots wrong. She continually cheated throughout the relationship, even with my friends. So I know that I could live a badass life, I wish I could. But I feel like a million and one perfect coincidences would have to occur for me to get into the headspace of being in control of my life. I've been on lexapro and now zoloft as well as lomotrigine and trazodone. The first two weeks of each of the antidepressants was like rolling on molly 24/7. But very soon the effects dwindled down to nothing as I now feel as awful as the day I found out what was happening. I'm simply uninterested in whatever the remainder of my life may consist of. I have felt just about as worthless and ugly a person can for a long time. I don't deserve to be here still. It's been two years. \n\nOn the other hand I do love myself and my family and friends. There are so many amazing possibilities... But it just isn't worth this unending surrealistic melancholy which removes any chance of self initiative to make myself happy. I just want to fucking od on oxy and be done with this shit. Every day all I can think of is how much I love her and how much I fucking hate her, she's a terrible person. I still can't find any other females attractive, at least not like her. Sex with other females has been really just... pointless. I'm not interested in anyone but this girl and it's ruined a good bit of my life. No way this gets good enough for me to look back and think that it was worth getting through this. You can't convince me otherwise.",

I've never been on medication as my family could never afford for me to see anyone or deal with anything. But I have become so desensitized and disassociated from the world that I feel as if I am just someone onlooking my own life, just to see it fail. I've never prepared for my future and the only real enjoyment that gives me euphoria is playing counter-strike, I am able to be empathetic but I am also unable to fully comprehend my feelings. I smoke so much weed it's going to kill me (I have a heart condition) but it doesn't stop me because my entire life I never admitted to having a heart problem. I don't like living, as each passing day I feel like my future it bleaker and bleaker, and I don't want to drag my current SO down with me. It's not normal to think of killing yourself everyday, but yet everyone thinks I'm fine and am joking. I'm sorry if any of this comes off as edgy it's not suppose to but it always has. \n\nI see everyone on medication and always think what if I got on it, but then I realize I'm so far down the rabbit hole it doesn't matter. \n\nI have days when I feel okay and days when all I can think about is throwing myself into the darkness (i.e. Crashing my car or slicing my wrists open when around sharp objects) and although I've never answered those calls they still exist. Whenever I would self harm is the only time people took interest in my problems, as if I had to show physical symptoms of my mental state of mind. And with the new era of \"everyone has depression\" I've been left out because I don't take medications or see a weekly therapist, I'm sorry I'm not rich so I can't relate to how everyone acts when they're off their pills, I've never been on them. \n\nI'm sorry I've wasted your time with this post but everything feels so bleak and I'm lying anytime someone asks me how I am or what my interests are, I don't reveal anything to anyone and the only one I share my interests with are myself because they aren't just waved away. \n\nive done too much wrong and I feel like no right will ever fix that. My own SO even made a joke that Xanax wouldn't work on me because it's for people with \"anxiety\", I've just given up, I've been living a lie for the last half decade and it gets less doable everyday.

            "selftext": "I think I'll end my life soon. My dear has it been a rollercoaster of a ride. From childhood I was destined for suffering. My family friend molested me, my family neglected me. My brother would often abuse me. I was bullied at school for being overweight and weird, all my childhood friends moved away and not one cared enough to stay in contact. The black sheep everywhere, even amongst others who stand out. I came out to my mum once about liking boys and she told me to hide it forever and basically told me a gay child was like a curse in her world. Then I came out at 18, told my crush I loved him and he showed my most vulnerable bit of writing ever to everyone. So I had to come out to everyone instead of slowly. I suffer from chronic depression, it's more active in my life than normalcy. I'm forced into an anhedonic state, agitated and irritated. I tried to seek help but it just didn't pan out properly. Then I came out as a Trans woman and life took another major turn. I'm either a sex object or guys use me for games. Literally, they talk to me, tell me how great and wanted I am and then POOF! Gone. I know it's sad but all I ever wanted was my other half. If I had them then everything else I genuinely believe could be shouldered... but I don't because I'm too broken to love. How many days I've fantasized about death and I tried, I really tried to die but failed twice!!\nI just want it to be peaceful and as clean as possible. Now, I'm rather empty inside, I don't have the energy to chase dreams or remain hopeful.\nQuite honestly, the pain is so physical it's debilitating. I legitimately don't know how I'm still  coming to work everyday or even moving at all.\nThis one guy, last year, came into my life and I thought everything was about to change for me. He gave me hope again. Uttered the sweetest things and then just left me to rot haha. Can you imagine \ud83d\ude02 you go through all of that and still life bangs you with a spiked pole. I'm not expecting a single person to read this, I just want to vent it out.\nI really tried my absolute best but it's just too much to carry. I can't even enjoy the presence of my mum and sister who've come down for the week. My mum's difficult and she has a habit of agitating me more whenever I'm out of it. I don't know why. I'm losing my shit with her and it's making me feel worse. I just want to vanish. To never have existed.\nI don't like this world and I don't want to be here anymore.",

I recently turned 20 and I feel like two decades is a good enough amount of time to decide this whole living thing isn\u2019t for me. People didn\u2019t even used to make it to 20, the life I\u2019ve had has been plenty. I know it will hurt people, my family and friends.

I am unfortunately granted life for some reason, my worthless life continuing to use up the world\u2019s finite resources. Even the air I\u2019m breathing now is too good for me. I really do wish I could just pop out of existence and everyone just continue on. But I\u2019m finally okay, I\u2019m not scared anymore. I am but not nearly as much, I\u2019m calm about it now. It won\u2019t be tonight, I need to stop crying and think about what I need to write in my note. If somehow you read this garbage, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for wasting your time and I\u2019m sorry to everyone in my life that I\u2019m such a fucking pathetic husk that\u2019s void of redemption. It is what it is and that\u2019s okay. ",

            "selftext": "Waiting for that special someone had just completely drained me mentally. It has never happened for me and most likely never will happen as pretty much the 2 times I do truly love someone end up in a disaster and the 3rd time doesn't go as badly but they ended up finding their special someone. I have also never had a girlfriend or even touched a girl for that matter. The first time I ever truly loved someone ended up in a massive disaster. A few months after I met them 4 years ago I absolutely fell in love after getting to know them and I always wanted to talk to them. On Facebook I started to like all of their pictures and then she thought I was a creep. Eventually I started cutting myself saying it was because of my grades but not even about that.Now in my formal for my 8th grade when she had a date and I had flowers for her I was absolutely devastated but she still talked to me and even offered to dance a little bit and I thought I was having a good time only to realize they just blocked me and completely cut me off. This was the moment I should have realized I was unlovable and not worth any love or affection but no 2 years later fell for someone even harder than the last time and it ended up way worse. This time a freshman girl was starting to talk to me and be all nice to me. At first I was a bit surprised a girl would actually talk to me but eventually started to fall for her. In fact she even invited me to sit with her and her friends at their lunch table which I did. Some days she even walked with me to class. Eventually she started to be quiet and suddenly ignored me which i started cutting again(this time my legs so no one could see) fearing I made the same mistake last time and eventually it turns out she thought I was creepy which caused me to look up suicide methods on a school computer. However I got caught and sent to a mental hospital for a week and lied and said I had the flu. This time I SHOULD have learned that I'm worthless,not worth love or affection,a complete waste of life with no redeemable traits. I ended up falling for this girls younger sister and I still love them even after 2 years of never mentioning to them only ever texting them about it(but they said its fine and we still talk to each other a lot which does say that this one wasn't a complete disaster but they eventually find someone and I was devastated as I had always wanted to tell her in person but was scared of this time it ending up horribly. I even heavily trusted them with things I never regularly tell others but soon they blocked me on social media(I learned it wasn't her and that her boyfriend removed all guys on her accounts and even started ignoring me in person for whatever reason) I don't even know why I try anymore. I'm nice to people,get good grades,and I try to stay in shape as well being pretty tall and rather skinny. I just quit. I should have learned no one cares for the nice guys. I should have just realized I was worthless and unwantable a while ago. Now all I really have is my old blankie to keep me comfort and warmth. All I'm going to give life is 7 years to prove me wrong but that is it. At 25 if I'm still forever alone I will commit suicide and be free from the life that I didn't want.In  2025 no more will I have to suffer the cold truth that i'm completely unloveable and just someone everyone steps on and replaces. Then at last may I be free of my ugly appearance,voice and my personality. I don't about my \"uniqueness\", myself just gets stepped on and replaced by someone a million times better than me in every way so it doesn't matter if I was to commit suicide. If love is a reason to live and my life is completely absent of it why move on?\n",

            "selftext": "The day after my 30th birthday, almost 4 months away. I've planned a trip abroad with friends before then. I'm starting a new, better job. I'm going to be meeting with a therapist soon. In other words, I have given myself every opportunity to change my mind between now and then.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting here. I guess I just wanted to tell my story. You can't really talk about suicide with most people, you know? It weirds them out. I have enough trouble keeping friends without that baggage.\n\nSo, here goes. I am estranged from my parents. They are not awful people or even awful parents by most standards, but they made me deeply unhappy growing up and I decided to remove them from my life years ago.\n\nI am alone. I have friendships, but they are superficial. I have had long-term girlfriends, but they never worked out. I have been in love once, and it ended badly.\n\nI have spontaneously developed chronic medical issues over the past year. My body is starting to break down.\n\nI spent the last decade trying to improve myself. I made progress, but it has become increasingly clear that my best self just isn't all that great.\n\nI'm not depressed. I don't have any of the symptoms. I'm just unhappy with who I am and I can't be fixed. I'm not likely to ever have the life I want. I gave it a real honest shot, but I'm tired. And I want to be done with it.\n\nSo, one day after my 30th birthday, I am going to kill myself. It's been a long, long time coming, delayed by years of hope. But I think I'm finally ready to go.\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "Hello so I am an 18 year old guy let me start with saying I am a coward but I had enough and I don't care what value this word have anymore. \n\nI really don't understand who I am or what should I do it drives me crazy it is like when I was a kid I pictured myself in my dream job surrounded by love from my wife and family and I couldn't ask more. \n\nBut nothing goes as planned it never did. I have never tried talking about my sucidial thoughts to anyone, since I was a little kid I just wanted to kill myself I went through people laughing at me in school being bullied   and back stabbed I tried overdosing myself with drugs but I didn't have the guts to do that in time I become fat which made me the joke of the class I left that school once I finished my junior high year I joined a different School in order to finish my high school thanks to the previous school I blocked myself from everyone and everything i stayed home and become an introvert who would go to school and go back home I stopped eating as much to the fact I reached 1 meal a day I destroyed my body clock and all what is left for me is escaping to the world I created where he can be himself without anyone judging or bullying. Later on I hit puberty I tried liking the other opposite sex and for my religion I knew it was a bad sign I was in love with someone in my classmate for 2 years until I graduated and we both went on our way. The fact that I am not sure if he had feelings for me or not tearing me apart he knew about my issues an introvert I felt like he understands me and know what I have been through just by looking at my eyes it felt like I am back to my successful rote he helped me blend with others he encouraged me to go out with him i felt like at last I am a normal guy like the rest of everyone but this happiness didn't last and I didn't have the guts to tell him how I feel about him when he left.\n\nNow I am in college I would like to thank the school for not showing me what part I belong in a college I had to go through this alone and there's the father who wants the best for you that he didn't care about subjects you suck at he only did it for his son to be educated due to my school grades I got a scholarship for a section I don't understand in college I tried to keep up but I just can't but I didn't give up if I screwed up something I need to fix up something and so I just went to college made lots of friends I even met someone I like this time I was sure I am not doing the same mistake by letting them go without knowing my feelings I confessed my feelings to him but he refused it he told me he is not interested I just cried inside me and I don't even know what is wrong from right anymore.. I tried my best to meet my father's expectations and the fact that he is low on finances but I couldn't understand what kind of subjects I was studying now I am a college drop out. I am doing nothing but crying inside me everyday knowing that I wake up to do nothing in my life I didn't spoke to anyone from my college since I left I blocked all my contacts i just thought that I can change this world or make them aware of how important this is issue is I don't want anyone to be as misreable as me. I kept fighting whenever life pins me down but this time I am sure it's the end that's it there's no place for me to go no sign that could lead me to anything I just lost faith in everything everyday I woke up and call myself as \"broken\"  I barely feel anything at all I built a wall around my heart I don't care about anything or anyone i said to myself that I can do whatever I want on my own I don't need anyone they will just make me weak and sensitive, I can be so much more I can get revenge from this whole life by throwing it away and stopping it so it can not harm me anymore or anyone else. \n\nI always had to accept me the true me this sensetive, adoring, loving, gay, white, understanding and wise guy. But I don't see any point anymore in this life there's no place to go and I think my life should end here.\n",

I don't know what to do.\n\nMy life is too fucked up to explain at this point. I have many debilitating health issues and my mind isn't any better.\n\nHumanity hates me. And they should. I hate me too. Sometimes I wonder if the suffering I endure is some kind of justice from the universe. Maybe there is a cosmic order to things and the universe is just giving me what I deserve.\n\nI don't like me. The people around me don't like me. Even the people that love me, my family, only does so out of unconditional love. If I was a friend, they would have cut me off long ago.\n\nI cause nothing but suffering to the people around me. I know everyone says this, but for me it's true: the world would very much be a better place without me.\n\nSometimes I wonder if suicide is my just punishment. I deserve to suffer. Is it more just to force myself to live in agony for the next ~60 years or to kill myself?\n\nI don't know why I'm posting here. I don't deserve any sympathy from anyone. I made my decisions to get here. I've done horrible things. Maybe a bottle if sleeping pills is too good for me. I've always been terrified of hanging, the pain.

I dont even find much fun in games anymore, same for manga, besides gaming anime manga as distraction, nothing made me feel better. I prefer to be alone and rarely communicate. I see friendships as pointless  and am not interested in any love related stuff due to things. I am 21 soon and i havent done anything besides high school. My future will be shitty but I dont seem to care. All i do lately is spam fortnite alone  sometimes with few of so called \"friends\" that I know only play because they are bored and i am someone just there to help pass time when they seem to want to play bit dont have their friends on, and when they do, they wouldnt have spot for me. So I stopped asking them to play and just spam it duo now, but i seem to be at the point where i have gone by years due to only distractions from life and I have read so much manga, watched so much anime, played so much of league, and now just killing time in fortnite, that everything seems pointless and I cannot have fun except for with 1-2 friends that i play with sometimes those play rarely. Without these distractions, I dont know what to do, I am as empty as one can be, nothing really matters to me anymore, i still dont consider suicide because I dont want to hurt family with my death, so i suffer and suffer, finding things to distract with, when I have no will for anything, no desire, no purpose. I would not mind if i die while i go out, only thing besides games and all these distractions was a period of time where i saw friendships and communications with people meaningless, i was young and braindead. I only realized that all of those meant nothing and its only people using each other. I dont know what to do anymore. Even going by a day feels hard, sometimes I wonder if i will break someday and end up killing myself after disregarding thoughts of family. I do care a lot about them but now, slowly i start wondering whether they will be just fine or ok after i leave or for me to end up dying in some accisent or so, but my love for them stops my thoughts everytime and i dont consider it. But i do know that I want to die for years now and i have only been living for family till now. ",

            "selftext": "Where to begin, I'm some 20 something Hispanic guy that lives in the New York New Jersey area. \n\nI grew up rather poor. \n\nI grew up somewhat alone. I mean I had friends but I never had much of a family to speak of. My mom is a very cold and damaged woman. She was a bit warmer at one point but only when it was easy. My dad was even worse off emotionally speaking, due to scars from his childhood.\nEmotionally speaking I've mostly been alone I've never been very good about broaching these topics.\n\nI'm a failure. \n\nThis would be easier to stomach if I could say I were stupid. But I can't because I got accepted and went to some smart highschool(less than 10 from my student body got in). I got an 1800 back when max was 2400 on the SAT having never studied for it or for much of anything. Mine is a story of disappointing people, my teachers, myself. Academically all I've ever done was coast by. In the sense that I've always done the minimum.\n\nMaybe I could make the excuse I were poor. That one is somewhat flimsy in some ways. Sure it is true I grew poor. But that highschool was a real opportunity. I essentially get paid to go community college. \n\nI have a therapist who tried their best. Can any therapist really replace the people who should've been there as I grew. The people who are supposed to guide and nurture. If you heard some of the stuff they told me as I grew HAH.\n\nMy point is I harbor a deep resentment for what my existence was compared to what I feel it could've been. Maybe I'm just weak I've seen some do more with comparatively similar financial and possibly familial situations. \n\nMy mantra after all this is \"no one cares\". If you had a chance to save someone what would you do? What would you give?  The answer to me is nothing. Everyone has their own lives, their own problems. \nHow can anyone afford to care in this world? Why would they stick their neck out like that? Most would rightly call them foolish. \n\nMy current existence is that of a leech and I can't bear it any longer. I had a job once worked at it for nearly a year but I didn't like trying to trick people to get stuff they didn't need.\n\nI actually intended to end it yesterday but turns out the place I needed closes at night. So I went to some hotel to think for a bit and try again tomorrow.\n\nAnyway I don't know what I hope to gain from this post. Maybe an opportunity, maybe some words as empty as they are, maybe a hand. I guess I just tire of the struggle. What am I fighting for? Myself?\n\nMy phone is getting somewhat low and I have no charger since this was kind of spur of the moment. So I'll check on this in some hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I come from a decent middle class family plenty of friends I guess. Ive always been considered smart and relatively attractive. But i absolutely hate myself. I feel useless. My life feels like its slowly unraveling and theres nothing i can do. I guess i just could use someone to talk to. I dont want to go to therapy cause it legitimizes my problem which i guess this already does. I'm terrified of getting medicated. The more i type the more disjoint this feels. I don't really expect people to respond and i might be too nervous to answer if people do. How do i validate my own life? It feels so wasted. ",

            "selftext": "I've been fat since I was a child, I was already fat at 4 years old, and I'm still a hamplanet now at 22. My entire school life was pretty much just being a target, at one point I even had a teacher who would go out of his way to embarrass me in front of the class. My childhood was going to school to get bullied, coming home, getting a few hours of peace, then my trashy, alcoholic bogan parents got too drunk and would start arguing until one of them went to bed. I remember I had two friends from during primary school, they'd come over my house and I'd go over theirs sometimes, but even then they wouldn't interact with me at school the same way they did with everyone else because I was both weird and fat. Sometimes they'd go out of their way to ignore me when other people were around, one of them was in the popular group in the class and I remember he'd tell me the inside jokes the others had about me. \n\n\nThis obviously continued into high school, I managed to make a couple of friends, but it was still third wheeling. They accepted me at school, but they didn't really want anything to do with me outside of it. The bullying kept going on, but I was better at just ignoring it then, so that's what I did. Eventually the depression hit, I'd spend nights laying awake in bed fantasizing about how I'd go about killing myself, crying, hurting myself, and just writhing around. I pretty much told myself my life was over then, my grades plummeted, I was eventually moved into a class for the problem kids, and again the next year, before they finally told me I wouldn't be going up a year level. I dropped out and got a job, I was actually excited for the future, I was happy, but then I found out real quick that when you're 17 working around nothing but people that are 40+, you might as well still be in high school. The snickering, the pointing and laughing, the weird in-jokes they had with each other about me, it was honestly worse than high school. It hit the point where I was considering running my finger through a band saw just to get away from it because my parents wouldn't let me quit. I did manage to catch up with this person I used to go to school with, we'd talk occasionally, but we weren't really friends. We started hanging out a lot, he introduced me to new people, it made me happy, but I was still eventually fired from my job. To make this long story short, the day I told the group that I ran out of money was the last day I ever heard from them. I just retired from life after that. I've spent the last 5 years locked in my room doing nothing, talking to strangers online until I mess something up and ghost them. \n\n\nMy entire life up until this point might as well have been a state of non-existence if I attempt to change. It might sound dramatic, but I told myself I'm going to change or kill myself at 25 if I'm still not happy with myself and my life. Part of changing was getting better with people, I thought I'd take small steps so I made a friend online. They're a few years younger than me and they tell me about their friends, which leads to stories about them in high school, which leads to more stories about different stuff in high school and it has really made me realize just how much I've missed. Hearing them tell me about all these good memories and experiences, telling me about all the sad yet good experiences that come along with actually having people in your life, telling me how much they love their friends, being able to hear how happy they are thinking back on it and talking about it. I can't take this. All it does is highlight how empty my life has been, sure I might not have had anything over the top or bad or horrible happen, but there's no fucking happiness either. I don't want to spend my whole life playing catch up, I don't want to have to spend my whole life behind everyone else, I'm going to have to learn to do all this, it's like dropping a child into an adults life at this point. Attempting to change and telling myself that I'll be happy one day is the worst thing I have ever done because all it did was make it all so obvious to me. \n\n\nI don't know how to describe this feeling, it's like I've never had a single person in my life actually care for me. All the friends I've ever had have kept me at a distance, but put up with me, or outright used me. My parents seem to love me, but in the way a parent loves a child, not as a person. I've heard my dad and his friend joking about me a few times before. At least once in my life, both my parents have called me a fat cunt, worthless, useless, and pathetic. I turn 23 in a week and right now I'm about 90% sure I will die on my birthday. I really don't want this to be my life, I don't think I can stand this having been my life.",

I have an irrational fear that I'll be locked away and forgotten about if I tell anyone my thoughts,   even though I have found people that at least sort of get it in the past. The problem is that I didn't want to deal with the issues at hand... to the point of completely ignoring anything that had to do with my issues,  then to make it worse I tried to express myself and I couldn't spit it out.  I made up some crap that sounded similar but still not addressing the main issue. To this day I have a really hard time talking about it. Complicated... yes.  Hurting me.. also yes.  I need it to end.  It's becoming unbearable.  I need to talk to some one. Soon. ",

            "selftext": "By all accounts I should be happy and grateful for my life. But I think about dying multiple times a day. Either through accident or suicide. I feel like I have no control over any of the aspects in my life. I don't feel like I get to chose what I do with it. I feel trapped in this bullshit just going through motions because they're considered something everyone should be doing. I feel hallowed out inside. Over the years it's like whatever inside me was good has just decayed. I feel that I've also become extremely bitter towards the world, wishing bad things on strangers for ridiculous things like a bad glance. I feel like my life is constantly hindered by my inability to perform up to anyone's standards. I'm constantly letting my wife down. I don't feel like a good role model for my daughter either. I feel like they would both be better off if I took a huge life insurance policy out on myself and just slit my own throat. At least then I could provide for them. Did I mention I'm 22? ",

            "selftext": "I met one of my closest friends back in 2008. We worked together, and started partying together on the weekends. I was one of the few females his wife would allow to hang out, get trashed, and stay the night. We were always there for each other, and spent our time joking and laughing.\n\nFour years later, he was getting a divorce. I was there for him, even though he relapsed. He got another place to live, found a new job, and his life was back in track. We hung out every weekend, and he finally got clean again. We were so proud!\n\nIn 2016, he became engaged to a wonderful woman. They moved in together and had a baby on the way. His life was so beautiful; his wedding was set for June 1, 2017. I took his fiance shopping for baby stuff in February, and she was due in May. She was having a boy, and they had just agreed on naming him Michael.\n\nOn April 12, 2017, I called to invite them for dinner. No answer. Strange, I thought, but I knew they were busy getting things ready for the baby. His little sister called me late that night, and she was crying so hard, she was almost incomprehensible. She was finally able to tell me that Dave was gone. His fiance found him hanging that morning.\n\nMy heart was broken, and it still is. I cannot imagine the pain of his fiance. That sweet, loving woman was about to have a baby, and she had lost the love of her life.\n\nWe spoke for about an hour this evening, and she's still heartbroken. Not a day goes by that she doesn't cry for Dave. Michael is a beautiful little boy, but he's never going to meet his dad. We have no idea what drove Dave to this point; life was finally looking up for him.\n\nHis sister and I covered the funeral expenses. We were in complete shock, and still are. This was the saddest day of our lives.\n\nI miss my friend so much, and I still think about him every day. I just can't believe he left us so soon; I'll spend the rest of my life wishing I could have helped. His fiance and sister probably feel at least ten times worse.\n\nPlease talk to someone if you feel like all hope is lost! There are people who really do care, even on your worst days.",

            "selftext": "I need advice. So I've been planning my suicide for awhile now. I'm going to do it in 2 months. The thing is that I'm not doing this because I feel cheated out on life, I'm doing it because I've realized I don't belong here. Every single night I have server breakdowns where I can't do anything but cry and scream for 2 hours. My therapist implies that this is me being immature and I have to grow up but this isn't the case. Other reasons include \n\u2022Being physically and mentally abused by my sister. She takes videos of my meltdowns and sends them to my peers to assure I'm a loser.\n\u2022I have a really bad back. My limbs and other body parts ache too, but it's my back that causes me stress and hours of squirming in my bed.\n\u2022I have little friends. The friends I have only talk to me in class. I haven't spent time out of school with someone for a year.\n\u2022Girls have no interest in me. When ever I try to talk to one I always mess things up. I get intimidated by guys so all my friends are girls. I just wish I had one person that really cared about me.\n\u2022I'm super awkward. I have no filter and can be rude sometimes. All I do is talk about video games and make sex jokes. Nobody likes that.\n\u2022I have more problems that I'm just not comfortable to say or that are similar to the other ones.\nBut here is why I need advice, I don't want people to feel like this is their fault because it's not, not even my sister. I need to do this to be happy. How do I convince the little amount of people that care about me to let me do this? How do I talk to my friends and family to get them to understand that I need this? Last time I did this the police came to my house and made things worse really. Thank you for reading this. It means a lot.",
